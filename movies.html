                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.<br><br>I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.<br><br>There is every kind of action imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles.<br><br>The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action.<br><br>There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.<br><br>Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.<br><br>About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.<br><br>The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.<br><br>Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.<br><br>John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.<br><br>Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.<br><br>Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.<br><br>The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.<br><br>As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.<br><br>Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close
Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.<br><br>Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.<br><br>Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.<br><br>Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.<br><br>Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.<br><br>Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.<br><br>Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.<br><br>As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.<br><br>While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.<br><br>Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.<br><br>One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.<br><br>Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.<br><br>The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.<br><br>Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.<br><br>I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the "dragons breath" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.<br><br>The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.<br><br>I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated "superhero" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?</div>

Stunt choreography , Camera work , editing and heart pumping BGMs were totally bonkers . There were many prolonged action sequences through out the movie , each of them never fails to deliver some thrill and adrenaline rush . Besides from action set pieces , JW4 well contributed in the world building and this whole tetralogy done a good job in World building &amp; character establishments , I hope it will be well used in its upcoming spin off series and movies . Cast did great job , especially Keanu Reeves and Donie Yen were great .<br><br>Cons - Few silly logical mistakes that you can't ignore .<br><br>Overall , to the action lovers and John wick fans out there don't miss out to watch it on big screen . Must watch . Highly recommended .</div>

<a href="/review/rw8952850/?ref_=tt_urv" class="title"> John Wick: Chapter 4 offered me 169 minutes of pure entertainment with an exciting cast of characters and action sequences that'll impress anyone, a perfect action film
</a>            <div class="display-name-date">
                    <span class="display-name-link"><a href="/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv">Holt344</a></span><span class="review-date">26 March 2023</span>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.<br><br>Bill Skarsgård as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.<br><br>The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.<br><br>Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsgård holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.<br><br>Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.<br><br>I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!<br><br>This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John "Baba Yaga" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.</div>

From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is "lesser" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.<br><br>I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :D<br><br>I know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.<br><br>Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.<br><br>I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.<br><br>A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.<br><br>The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.<br><br>As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.<br><br>Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsgård. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.<br><br>This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Far better than I was expecting. Not that I thought it was going to be a bad movie in the slightest, but I was not expecting to be so bedazzled by it. John Wick has stepped up to the plate and hit that man meal out of the park every single time. Keanu Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski have done everything in their power to keep the action constant.<br><br>The odd part about that is that this movie did not have the best action sequences out of all the movies, but it did have the most in depth story. That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.<br><br>Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.<br><br>Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit. Now I want them to do a spin off movie with Scott Adkins in that fat suit.<br><br>I would keep going but I do not want to be as long as the movie was. Do not worry you don't even notice. The film is too hard hitting for that.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">"John Wick: Chapter 4" is one of the most captivating, exciting, eye-popping, hyperkinetic, and beautiful action films ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.<br><br>Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsgärd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.<br><br>The masterful elements at play in "Chapter 4" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.<br><br>Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacré Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.<br><br>The elaborate and visceral set designs are "Chapter 4's" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming "wow!" in wonderment.</div>

John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.<br><br>There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !<br><br>This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.<br><br>John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.<br><br>Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.<br><br>JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5/10.</div>

An intertwining of interests rooted in common found circumstances, history, connection, as well as coincidence and luck. As he came back into this life a free man, he wills to fight to leave just as he came no matter the cost.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.<br><br>Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.<br><br>Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).<br><br>I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.<br><br>I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.<br><br>March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.</div>

John wick 4 is visually stunning and at the same time is engaging .The running length is almost 3 hour but feels like 2 hr . The editing is crisp and on point . The action choreography and Set pieces are phenomenal . John Wick 4 is arguably the best action movie of this decade . The stellar star cast comprised Keanu Reeves , Doni Yen , Ian McShane , Hiroyunki Sanada,Bill Skarsgard ,Scott Adkins ,Laurence Fishburne and Late Lance Reddick etc are apt in their respective role .Kudos to the director and his team for gifting us such an amazing cinematic experience .</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">"You'll run out of bullets before they run out of heads." Winston (Ian McShane with ascot)<br><br>For John Wick: Chapter IV, the heads keep rolling, mostly decommissioned by the titular assassin's preternaturally accurate gun, and partly because it seems everyone now wears a bulletproof jacket often used as a shield. Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.<br><br>As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a "dragon's breath shotgun"! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).<br><br>Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.<br><br>It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like "Second chances are the refuge of men who fail" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.<br><br>Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.<br><br>I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is "Have you given any thought to how this ends?"<br><br>I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies. John Wick: Chapter IV is as good as the best action films we will see all summer, and that bountiful crop has yet to start. Stay tuned.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 joins Mad Max: Fury Road in being the fourth film in an action franchise that is also hands-down the best film in its franchise.<br><br>The pacing issues present in the last two movies are nowhere to be seen here; remarkable, given the behemoth 169-minute runtime. It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.<br><br>Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.<br><br>This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.<br><br>But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.<br><br>The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of "actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.<br><br>But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this. Chapter 4 is the display of a master action filmmaker who continues to dare to go bigger and bolder, and I can't wait to see what kind of spectacle he presents us with next.</div>

If you're gunna see anything this wkd, see John Wick Chapter 4.<br><br>It's a nonstop, adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride full of tension, action and suspense. And you don't have to be up to speed with the other JW films, necessarily. The 2nd Act is dedicated to JW enthusiasts, but it's not too difficult to follow.<br><br>There's also an unrecognizable moviestar in hair &amp; makeup (and a fat suit) that I clocked (I won't spoil it--yet). He is hilarious in the role -- very much like Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) in "Tropic Thunder."<br><br>The 3rd Act of JW4 is worth the price of admission. This is, by far, the best movie of the year (so far) and the last hour is one of the best finales of any action film in recent memory.<br><br>Shoutout to the production crew. This film doesn't work without the crew. The stunt coordinators, the sound mixers/designers, safety staff, grips, hair &amp; makeup, choreographers, costumers and the animal trainers.

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.<br><br>But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......<br><br>First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.<br><br>So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?<br><br>Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.<br><br>There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.<br><br>The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.<br><br>The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.<br><br>Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.<br><br>Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.<br><br>And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.<br><br>All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.<br><br>What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.<br><br>But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.<br><br>This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.<br><br>Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.<br><br>'Chefs Kiss'</div>

What else does anyone expect from a john wick movie. The last one hour of this movie is just like blazing fire. Keanu reeves, i dont think i can see him in any other character unless he cuts his hair or something. He just shines in the action sequences and embodies this character completely. All the extras and other actors give an amazing performance. Action sequences, top notch. Cinematography, top notch. Music, top notch.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.<br><br>Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.<br><br>The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.<br><br>Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsgård is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.<br><br>Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.<br><br>Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.<br><br>The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.<br><br>The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Given the sad state of Hollywood output these days, this is one of the better offerings. But it does require some suspension of disbelief. You have to believe that 58 year old 175 lb Reeves is a dangerous man. And that sorta works. You also have to believe that this franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-retirement from Asian films was really a good idea? And the writers have stolen tropes and tricks from a handful of prior productions including KUNG FU (wise sayings); MY NAME IS NOBODY; VANISHING POINT (radio overlay); THE BLIND SWORDSMAN; THE GAUNTLET; and of course the first 3 movies in the series. The one quote that best applies here was left out of the script -- "in the realm of the blind, the one-eyed man is King". ((Designated "IMDb Top Reviewer."

I've seen a lot of films and I think this is the best action film I've seen. Definitely the best action film saga. I had to wait in the theater for a long time because I was just so blown away by how well made this film was.<br><br>The lighting has evolved with each movie and it was absolutely stunning. And that goes along with the cinematography. Just absolutely beautiful shots. And of course the choreography was incredibly well orchestrated. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE STUNTS. There seriously needs to be an Oscar for choreography and stunt work.<br><br>This one is for Lance Reddick. We all love him and will miss him dearly. Bravo.</div>

Not just best John wick movie or the one of the best action movie but a Truly Beautiful Movie (yes hundreds of people does die brutally here) but the way every scene especially the fight choregraphy is shot, its nothing short of a masterpiece. From the great actors, to the epic storyline, the comedic scenes (yes there would be many) to the extraordinary breath taking scenes, its all just perfect. The 2nd best movie i ever saw in theatres (after the endgame ofcourse). Nonethless, its a movie worth missing everything for, just go out there watch it in theatres especially in 4DX. Or you might just regret it for the rest of your lives!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Parabellum (part 3) was my favorite and as is the case in many sequels, hard to keep topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team. They keep figuring out ways to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries, each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This is one of those movies that must be watched on the big screen.</div>

I always read the bad reviews only.<br><br>When i see many reviews that say "worst movie ever" the chances are high that the movie is decent and worth a view. Those people never watch actually bad movies or they would know that there is no one worst movie ever... There is thousands of them...<br><br>When i see many reviews that say "I'll never get those 2 hours back" or "i wasted 2 hours of my life" i know that the movie is pretty good and I'm gonna like it. To those people... Just sleep less time some days. Even 5 minutes less a day can get you your wasted hours back in no time...<br><br>But when i see even just one review that complain about that the fourth movie of a franchise is the worst and the whole franchise sucks and yet they have sit through the whole franchise since they are able to criticize it, then the movie is a masterpiece...
And Chapter 4 is a masterpiece...
Enjoy if you are an action fan, you deserve this👍👍👍<br><br>Update: When i see reviews with the expression "Are people blind"? The movie is probably an 11/10. Blind people have their other senses very enhanced and know better from people with mediocre levels of all of their sense and are completely ignorant about what subjective means...</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.<br><br>With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.<br><br>The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsgård plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.<br><br>Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.<br><br>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I never thought I would say this, but it's rare when a film executes everything it can to be just as good or if not better than it's past films in a franchise and John Wick: Chapter 4 does that in every single way possible. While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade. Rating 10/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a "John Wick" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front "John Wick: Chapter 4" delivers and then some.<br><br>There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.<br><br>Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.<br><br>At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.<br><br>So is it a great film? Well yes because "John Wick: Chapter 4" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is the latest installment in the popular action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin. Directed by Chad Stahelski, who helmed all the previous films, this sequel continues the story of John Wick's quest for freedom from The High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the underworld. Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.<br><br>The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.<br><br>The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsgård plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.<br><br>The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.<br><br>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">"John Wick: Chapter 4" is the fourth film in the "John Wick" franchise. Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.<br><br>Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as "Mr. Nobody" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsgård). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.<br><br>Almost a decade since its debut, the "John Wick" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but "John Wick: Chapter 4" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.<br><br>Now that he's "excommunicado", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.<br><br>Something else I've admired about "John Wick" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.<br><br>For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.<br><br>Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.<br><br>Even after four movies, the "John Wick" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world. This fourth film has not only helped redefine the series as a whole but also what action movies are capable of in general. Personally, I would love to see another "John Wick" film but according to director Chad Stahleski, this will be the last one for a while with the spin-off film "Ballerina" and miniseries "The Continental" coming soon to fill the void in the meantime. Either way, it looks like this series is here to stay.<br><br>I rate it a solid 9/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">So i watched the movie in IMAX. The beginning blew me away already, punch after punch my head felt like it wanted to explode in the first minute of the film, whole Theater vibrated and set the mood for the rest of the movie. The action and fight scenes are incredible. My jaw dropped almost every five minutes into the action, creative teamwork and deaths. Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me. Incredible locations and mood switches, intense moments combined with the IMAX system was just so dope. Of course there were some unrealistic moments where a normal human would have been dead already, but it is a movie, so they got to keep Mr. Wick alive somehow.<br><br>Would recommend!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I can think of no other series of movies that consistently improves upon itself than the John Wick series. This fourth installment improves even upon the fantastic third movie. The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always, phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences. Make the effort to view this movie at the cinema, as you will get the full cinematic experience that this film needs to show all of the work put into it.</div>

Like you are a drone looking in on the action. Yeah some lemon haze half way in was a good choice for me. Better than a video game! Hard to believe I did not know so many of the spoilers since I followed the online info pretty closely. Over the last few pandemic years. Keanu is the quintessential action movie star. John Wick IS the wrathful deity. I have heard it will be available for streaming in May. I'll be running it all day.<br><br>Not for kids.

It's non stop action from start to finish. Keanu is one of the greatest action stars to ever live. I really hope they make more. The fight choreography is second to none, the gun play better than ever, and the casting is stupendous. The plot is top notch, the Wickverse is better than the Marvel Universe and any film universe. He deserves all the plaudits for what he has done with this character. You need to see this movie multiple times. Best film I have seen at the cinema in a very long time..</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet. Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie.</div>

The movie doesn't leave the humor out and there's lots of laughs in between the fighting.<br><br>Scott adkins doing a funny and effective role of a bodyguard with nine lives. And there's also a dog fighter!<br><br>Keanu is amazing as always as wick, the man that of you throw away from the door he will jump on you from the window.<br><br>The plot moves fast, the fight in the middle of the highway is unbelievable and there's lots of jackie chan style stunts that I never saw in a western movie. Maybe consider bringing him to chapter 5.<br><br>One of the best action/ martial arts film ever made.</div>

The editing was spot on, the scenery and focal shots are amazing, All of the actors were outstanding, the effects were some of the greatest I have ever seen, and the variety in the fight sequences was refreshing and new. The director and writer really nailed the action and entertainment in this movie. Honestly I was little worried that they couldn't keep up with the franchise going at such a high level, I'm glad it was not the case with this one.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 as with the past three films continues to develop its world, its characters, goes bigger with the amazing action set pieces, and amazing fight chrography.<br><br>One of my biggest concerns going into this film was its run time as I have felt the John Wick movies do not garner a two plus hour film so if they want to do a movie that's damn near three hours then the story needed to deliver...<br><br>And I am very happy to say they delivered with great storytelling.<br><br>The film did not start as fast as I anticipated it would but instead opened up establishing new characters and its story. In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.<br><br>The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.<br><br>But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.<br><br>Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.<br><br>Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed! As Winston said...<br><br>"He was a friend"<br><br>If this is the final Chapter in the John Wick storyline then I am very pleased with its conclusion but as I mentioned there's plenty of opportunity for more in this world.<br><br>IMDb: 9/10
Letterboxd: 4/5<br><br>Watched in Theaters.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">If you enjoyed JW 1-3, you can't miss this one. It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.<br><br>It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).<br><br>Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.<br><br>What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.<br><br>Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.<br><br>And the magic!<br><br>First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.<br><br>Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.<br><br>That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.<br><br>Now, why only 8 points?<br><br>Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.<br><br>Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).<br><br>Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.<br><br>No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.<br><br>The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.<br><br>Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.<br><br>There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.<br><br>The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.<br><br>This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure, you might feel cheated.</div>

Can you find a movie character more exciting than John Wick?? Jason Bourne is a close second but the visuals in this franchise make this series fun to watch.<br><br>Fast forward to this installment where the stakes are higher for John Wick. There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film is fast and exciting.<br><br>One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch. It's hard not to think about what happen recently with his passing while promoting this movie. Other supporting characters make it woke up until the very end but Reddick will be missed.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. "Parabellum" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.<br><br>Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy, that was just a huge let-down.<br><br>And as much as I love all the action scenes, and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. Nevertheless, still an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better.</div>

I was definitely enthralled and it never left you anywhere but on the edge of your seat. I found it to be engaging, funny, and thrilling while still feeling heartwrenching and shocking in so many different and unexpected ways. It was a movie that our entire family enjoyed and I feel Keanu hit the ball out of the park, per usual. This franchise is summarized in a bittersweet way but the ride is worth the ending nevertheless. Five huge stars for a wonderful ensemble cast! Loved this movie and really think most fans will too.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.<br><br>The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!<br><br>All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.<br><br>Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.<br><br>Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial "managing" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">SCORE: 7.2/10<br><br>The biggest roller coaster of roller coasters I've ever been on while watching a movie in theaters. It was good, then it was bad, then it was great, then boring, then absolutely amazing, then disappointing. If we are speaking solely about the Action, this was the greatest Action movie of all time. Every fight was legendary and the new tricks and weapons they used were unlike anything I've ever seen before. The exploding shotgun, the ultra-realistic fighting choreography, and the entire world getting bossed up by Mr. Wick. If the movie were just all of the fight scenes mashed together, this may have been a perfect movie. However, unfortunately, as movies tend to go, there also happens to be a story element to them. And for John Wick 4, it was atrocious and easily the worst story in the franchise.<br><br>Anytime the new villain was on screen it was a complete snooze fest, apart from the end where he gets a bullet in the head. Some of those scenes went on way too long and made some of the Action scenes less impactful because of what we had to go through to get there. I was excited when I saw the 2hr and 49 minute runtime, as I loved the first 3 John Wicks, but this movie had no business being that long. So much of it should've been cut out. There was way too much plot armor given to the head of security for the High Table and the guy he meets the card table, which made it felt forced at times. I have no problem with all the plot armor given to John Wick, but I was not a fan of those other characters being portrayed in that way.<br><br>Now for the 2 most problematic parts of the movie. For one, can they make up their mind when it comes to the relationship between John and Caine and the Tracker? They're fighting against each other and then working together and then fighting against each other and then working together and then half fighting against each other and half working together. It felt sloppy and inconsistent in a way that was not productive. Lastly, HE DIES? You have got to be kidding me. It's not just the fact that he dies, but it's the way it happens. Granted, there is probably a 99% chance he's still alive, but absolutely nothing in his final conversation with Caine and Winston made me thinking he was dying. And now he just collapses over on the stairs and it cuts to his tombstone? For everything he was able to endure throughout the 4 films, it was a pretty pathetic way to end the movie and it felt like a slap in the face. John Wick deserved way better. We also still got virtually nothing about his wife apart from a single flashback, an element that should've been explored by now.<br><br>This movie review is long because I'm very passionate about John Wick and I love his character and the movies that came before this one. To end on a positive note, there were still a bunch of good things that happened in this film that were just unfortunately watered down by the length of the film and the rest of the story. The humor was phenomenal, both Caine and the Tracker's character were great additions, and there were a lot of high impact scenes, such as John saving the Tracker's dog. Lastly, RIP to the legend Lance Reddick. I know he didn't have a major part in this movie, but he has given a memorable performance in each of the prior movies and was so talented. Taken from us way too soon.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have returned with "John Wick: Chapter 4," a film that was supposed to hit theaters two years ago. It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgård), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman."John Wick: Chapter 4" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacré-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead. Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and introduces fresh blood in the cast, such as Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I saw so many action movies even all the previous John Wick movies and i need to say that this movie put the standard pretty high. The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacré coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest). A nice action movie. No doubt about it.</div>

And I have recently watched the three previous John Wick movies on video and I thought they were pretty good.<br><br>Now comes the new movie "John Wick Chapter Four" and nothing could prepare me for how great this movie is. It is easily the best John Wick movie and one of the best action movies ever made. The director Chad Stahelski and the star Keanu Reeves have outdone themselves and created an excellent film that is one of the most entertaining movies of the year as long as you don't mind the nonstop violence.<br><br>The movie is violent but beautifully choreographed with colorful and superb production design. This is the best action movie since "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and one of the best movies of the year.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?<br><br>Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.<br><br>Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?<br><br>And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?<br><br>Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.</div>

John Wick : Chapter 4 is the best sequel of the series and one of the greatest action films ever made! You've got so many amazing stars, awesome fight scenes and stunts with a straight up simple plot that is kill or be killed in its absolutely biggest way in this spectacular sequel... Keanu Reeves is always the show stealer as its titular character with his badass performance and stunts... Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick reprise their roles and as usual they were great... Also I've got to say the new cast of the John Wick franchise, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins, Clancy Brown, Hiroyuki Sanada and the rest of them were all awesome as well... So far I feel this is my number 1 movie of the year... If you're already a John Wick fan, you're gonna be mindblown in your seats and if you're not, trust me, you're gonna be a fan soon...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.<br><br>Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.<br><br>The Paris sequences &amp; pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow &amp; arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.<br><br>The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.<br><br>I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.<br><br>Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.<br><br>Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This movie has the same plot as before: John Wick against the rest of the assassin world with longer running time. What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.<br><br>Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.<br><br>Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.<br><br>And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!. I really want the movie to be finished asap.<br><br>However, as I said, the character development is nice and the gun-fu which are shot from above from room to room is also memorable. I quite enjoyed them. 7/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie has set a really high bar for movies, honestly the best movie and hope it wins oscar. If you are going to see this movie your attention will fully in the movie and won't be distracted at all, the action scenes are the best and Suprisingly there is more comedy than i expected and the dialogues form each character is great. There are obviously some problems with few parts of the movie but it doesn't affect much to the movie, problems such as few scenes where it was looking obvious it was cgi but the cinematography made up for it ,and Secondly it felt like Wicks pistol had unlimited bullets and it did make it feel a little unrealistic and lastly the end credit disappointed a little bit,we expected the end credit would be something unexpected and mind-blowing but it did kinda disappoint.<br><br>But overall with these problems it still didn't matter as the movie was on another level its the best chapter out of 1 2 3 and it was worth the wait of 4 years . And might be one of the best action movie. This movie was loved by the audience in the theatre they enjoyed every part of the movie the reaction were great
The hype about this movie was worth it and you would want to watch it multiple times.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Ridiculous, ultra violent and nearly 3 hours long 'John Wick: 4' is pure escapism at its finest. No one goes to see a 'John Wick' movie for anything remotely close to realistic fights or gun battles- it's about the body count, hand to hand combat and just how far the director will take things as John absorbs so much abuse yet hardly comes away with a scratch!<br><br>I usually avoid movies like this however will admit it took my mind off the daily crap of life. This one is much better than the last one- Halle Berry's character was more annoying to me than a female killing machine complement to Keanu Reeves' character.<br><br>There are scenes in Paris, New York and Berlin - topnotch cinematography that surpasses the other films. And the fight scenes are well scripted- kudos to the work Reaves and the stunt people put in to make them outrageously entertaining!<br><br>Is this the last film in the series?<br><br>Maybe... However if this brings in a ton of money rest assured there will be another one.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick Chapter 4 is everything you'd want from this tremendously popular franchise. I would describe it as pure "choreographed aggression," like a delicate ballet. But instead of Swan Lake, this is all about bullets and knives. Incidentally, don't trouble yourself with a body count. The sheer number and intensity of "kills" will truly elude you.<br><br>JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic "ultra violence" of Stanley Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin.<br><br>It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick &amp; company's dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to this newest Chapter. "Sauce for the goose," one might say.<br><br>Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care. This is what makes cinema so FUN, especially now that we're all feeling some relief in this post-pandemic world. JW4 is heavy, exciting, and has plenty of authentic action. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!</div>

-It's simplistic, it's extreme, and it's these characters that you love to just grip on to in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>-And yet it all works together in this action heavy movie, to still create these elements that you love in this film to have a little more meat than some other films in the action genre.<br><br>-I disagree with the top billing, but I have a trend so.<br><br>-Georgiou is fine for the like three minutes in the film, and sadly his story does not have much merit to the film, so let's move on.<br><br>-Ian McShane is excellent as Winston, cultured, classy, and though not the star, stealing the show in those moments with well-executed class, poise, and comedic delivery.<br><br><ul><li>Bill Skarsgård is great in the villain role again. Not quite as dynamic, but captures his dad's intensity as the big baddy who causes a lot of trouble with ruthless efficiency.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Donnie Yen is awesome in the action roles, and he has an incredible prowess in choreography and delivery to make him a stand up character in this universe, like Rogue One on adult steroids.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Shamier Anderson is good for the times he's in, and that's all I can say to not give too much away. Quite, calculating, but gifted in the edge of this action series, he belongs well in this chapter and universe for many things.</li></ul><br><br>-Fisburne is fine for when he is on stage, he just needed more time, involvement and dare I say development that Chapter 3 and the commercial s promised.<br><br>-As for Reeves, the man may not be the best actor, but he is awesome in terms of stunts, very blunt edges, comedic delivery (intentional and unintentional), and just that feeling by saying little. He struggles with, well some other things, but somehow it works given his character.<br><br>The Story Building
-I've said it several times, but yeah, there is a bit more of the story in this one and much more character development than the past.<br><br>-Wick's fourth chapter really starts to expand upon Wick's background, while opening up the facets of new characters and trying to help build more of the past.<br><br>-It's endearing, it's deeper, and establishes layers to characters for books, and other media can expand upon if the movies ever dry up or won't go down the prequel path.<br><br>-And this particular chapter has enough of the now moments to help things really engage and be intense to help Wick's story continue to expand into levels that just make you continue to root for this character.<br><br>-Which leads to the next like.<br><br>The Emotions Surprisingly
-This movie is emotional because it really pushes into those little divots from the past and extends them to more engaging character moments.<br><br>-Chapter 4 uses the music, the footage, and the story to great levels and establishes moments that help ground the action and silence the action edge.<br><br>-And it's extraordinarily balanced to the point that it only adds not takes away from the story, and gives stakes and care to the action sequences they designed.<br><br>-Having such investments into this movie helps get past the usual stereotype of mindless action without much else, and if you are hooked to Keanu's character, you are in luck with this installment really polishing him up.<br><br>The Special Effects
-You have to make this movie shine to capture the action and make it really shine in this world that makes "action" movies.<br><br>-It works. Wick's scenes have the sound to capture and bring you into the mix. Bullets bouncing, clips discharging, swords clanging and explosions rattling with the music.<br><br>-But the audio only goes so far if you don't have the visuals, and Wick's team has you covered there with tricks and trades that make the insanity come to life.<br><br>-Amidst impressive sets, Wick has stellar visual effects as the extras go flying from the stunts as computer and reality combines to make believable bouts of death on the screen.<br><br>-Flashes of guns, people falling back, blood, and reactions all work together and really make things that insane bout of action that I expected and love in this series.<br><br>-And it's all captured with camera work and editing that doesn't get lost to shaky work, or that realistic found footage twist that annoys me with some action films. That works super well with me.<br><br>The Action Sequences
-The heart of this movie, Wick is all about the action. Clocking in at roughly 88% of the movie by my calculations, Wick's longest film adds A LOT MORE action than I anticipated.<br><br>-Simplistic at first, the movie evolves to add story elements to each fight, while also adding different styles to help diversify the profile , which I greatly appreciated.<br><br>-Sword fights with physical moves and gunplay opens up at one point, and then we switch to different combats the next as the five sequences help add new styles to freshen things up.<br><br>-And again it works with the emotion and the story to help add that stakes I like, alongside some of the justice filled finishes you love so much.<br><br>Dislikes:<br><br>Too late for this level of Storytelling
-Was the storytelling too late? In a sense for me, yes. Wick may not be known for the plot, but to take such strides and character development this late in the game might have been weaker to me.<br><br>-These new relationships seem random. The history lost to the fast pace and stunts, that they don't have the full time to commit for me to be worth it.<br><br>-Throw in the ploy to potentially capitalize on it further and well... it's not the worst, but it just didn't have the full meat I think they could have done.<br><br>Some Plots Rushed
-The fast pace means the attempts to build plots is also very quick, this film trying to tie many elements from 1-3 into one film, which means lots of details to revisit.<br><br>-Nostalgia wise, it worked for me, but these moments were very quick, and limber, again leading to a weaker story in my opinion.<br><br>-For an action flick it's good, but for the legacy of Wick, it could have been better, and perhaps this is going to be a lead in to some spin off given the trend of Hollywood and streaming.<br><br>Loud In My Showing
-I may sound old, but if you have sensitive ears, caution for the movie is very loud to the point it can be very distracting.<br><br>-If you too are sensitive, just exercise caution so you don't injure anything.<br><br>Still Some Level of Absurdity
-I know Wick is already extreme and absurd at times, but I'm always looking to see where they go too far.<br><br>-And this movie has a few moments that are a bit hard to swallow and ignore at the cheese factor that they take to make their fantasy come to life.<br><br>-One thing is the costumes they adorn and how selective their immunity is, there is a little more explanation, but it's quite amazing to see the double standards.<br><br>-Other times it's about the invincibility factor that Wick seems to have, alongside the recovery part that gets stretched a little too much for my tastes. It might be part of the magic, but, the absurdity still is going a tad too far since the first movie.<br><br>The Final Sequence Makes the Movie A Tad Long
-I'm one for action, but in this case, the final fight sort of extends the feature a bit longer than I personally enjoy given how absurd the final moment is.<br><br>-A climb so to speak goes a tad longer, and though the moves are awesome, the comedy great and the tying of things together works... it does not offset that it wasn't needed given what was coming.<br><br>-Chapter 4's length is going to be a solid hook for the die-hard fanbase, but for others like me, that final fight just goes a tad too long given there is still another action moment to come.<br><br>The After Credit Scenes
-The fact there is one has me shake my head, but that aside, this chapter serves as something to try to tie up a loose story end they forgot, or maybe set the stage for what is next.<br><br>-All I can say is that a long list of names to get there was mediocre in terms of what could be set up when it comes the world the High-Table focuses on. But was it needed? My opinion... no, not at all.<br><br>The VERDICT:
John's fourth adventure was shaping to be one of the best action movies for me in a long time, and perhaps one of the best in this series. It's got heart, emotion, and depth I did not expect as the worlds collided and it balanced a lot of things to integrate into the action moments. The movie is visually impressive, a stunning collaboration of sound and video that combined with the planning, just gives this elite fighting movie moxie to make you squirm in your seat. And with all the dark antics and violence, this genre really does have a pinnacle sequel on hand to give the fans more of what they want, but actually push the envelope with it. And yet.. the movie still has things that are needing fine tuning to push to the pinnacle of movies. Absurdity is one thing, but pacing still has some things to work on to help give the movie the bite it wants, alongside the fact of trying to do a pinch more of character balancing that they seem to struggle. Nevertheless, this movie is definitely the leading film of the month right now, and has many things to drag you to the theater to see it. My scores are:<br><br>Action/Crime/Thriller: 9.0<br><br>Movie Overall: 8.0.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.</div>

The film follows John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as he seeks revenge against the High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the world of assassins. Along the way, John Wick encounters old friends and foes, such as Caine (Donnie Yen), a blind former colleague forced to hunt him down; Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), a hotel manager who offers him sanctuary; and Chidi (Marko Zaror), a ruthless enforcer who works for the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård), a senior member of the High Table. "John Wick: Chapter 4" is directed by Chad Stahelski, who also helmed the previous three films, and written by Shay Hatten, Michael Finch, and Derek Kolstad.<br><br>The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all previous John Wick films, and written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. The script is tight and well-paced, balancing exposition with action and humor. The dialogue is witty and memorable, with some nods to previous films and pop culture references.<br><br>"The film delivers on its promise of non-stop action and thrilling stunts that showcase Reeves' physical prowess and dedication.

The fight scenes are inventive and brutal, ranging from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to car chases, among others.

Yen showcases both his martial arts skills and acting chops in several scenes with Reeves. Skarsgård is menacing as the Marquis de Gramont, one of John's main antagonists, bringing sophistication and cruelty to his role. Additionally, Sanada, Anderson, Sawayama, Adkins, McShane, Fishburne, Reddick, Brown, Georgiou, Zaror, and Tena all deliver solid performances in their respective roles."<br><br>The film's only flaw is that it may be too violent for some viewers .

The film also has some scenes that may be considered unrealistic or implausible , such as John surviving multiple injuries or escaping certain situations . However , these are minor issues that do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film .<br><br>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) provides an entertaining and thrilling experience for fans of action movies and admirers of Keanu Reeves' charisma. The film offers plenty of adrenaline-pumping action sequences that showcase Reeves' prowess as an action star. John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike .

                <div class="text show-more__control">Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours &amp; 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 &amp; this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!<br><br>The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out &amp; fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?<br><br>Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours &amp; 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant &amp; forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss &amp; started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!<br><br>The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny &amp; brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast &amp; annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains &amp; bad guys though again, it got repetitive &amp; irritating.<br><br>The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (&amp; lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think "dafuq!?"<br><br>The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying &amp; held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating &amp; made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged &amp; felt &amp; looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying &amp; reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!<br><br>Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!<br><br>John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes
John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes
John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes
John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutes<br><br>Notice how the films got long &amp; long with each entry...!<br><br>Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing &amp; overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare &amp; when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long &amp; annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad &amp; anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!<br><br>4/10 &amp; that's generous considering!</div>

The movie runs almost 3hrs and you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off for even a minute.<br><br>Bill skarsgard was a nice addition to an already perfect casting. Especially Donnie yen stood out of all the others. Also Shamier as Mr. Nobody was fun to watch.<br><br>As for the fight sequences, Keanu Reeves has given his everything to it and it reflects well in the film.<br><br>Another standout thing is the cinematography of the movie. It has some brilliant shots especially the final duel has amazing cinematography.<br><br>Overall John wick chapter 4 is undoubtedly one of the best action movies ever made and will be an absolute treat for the fans.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Its also ridiculous,. Outrageous, ludicrous, and hilarious. They have uncut action scenes that last for minutes now. Easily the overall best action stunt movie for the art. Simple story and Wick indestructible. But so worth it. Fighting up an endless staircase against innumerable foe to the music of Justice. Bravo. The most imaginative chorography fight scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can it not be the perfect action movie created. From fists to firearms this movie does not miss a beat. The best of the best of the best fight scenes. Take a bow.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick 4 picks up where the previous film left off, and it does not disappoint. Keanu Reeves returns to the titular character, John Wick, and once again delivers a breathtaking performance that is sure to leave fans in awe. However, this time around, Reeves is not the only one stealing the show. Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.<br><br>Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsgård plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.<br><br>The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.<br><br>But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.<br><br>The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.<br><br>The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.<br><br>Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.<br><br>In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie.</div>

I hope a statue of him will be placed inside the Hollywood Museum. In terms of photography, it is very good and second to none, as well as accuracy and adjustment on some small things. They have great capabilities, and we do not forget the sound and other effectsWe waited for John Wick for a long time, just waiting for the showtime in Iraq cinema, to feel alive thanks to this elephant. Thank you Keanu Reeves and thank you to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This is a tough one. Not only to review, but also to watch. Never before have I seen a movie where the opponents are so obviously taking turns attacking. There are countless scenes in this movie where John Wick is fighting multiple opponents and every one except the one he is currently fighting is dancing around awkwardly in the background until its their turn to attack. It's infuriating. And it happens constantly throughout the movie.<br><br>Now, not everything about the action is bad. Some of the fight scenes are awesome, mostly the ones where he is fighting someone one on one.<br><br>The camera work, scenery, set design are all beautiful. Even the story of this installment is better than what we had previously. The movie also introduces a couple of fantastic new characters and the conclusion is quite satisfying.<br><br>All that to be completely underminded by the truly atrocious fight choreographies throughout the movie. They made this an absolute chore to watch at times.</div>

Yeeahh :) Some scenes in the movie bothered me. Especially the scenes of not bleeding and cops scenes, but still, I think it was very good. It was fun to watch in the cinema. Same scenese were funnish. It wasn't necessary. Also, the shooting scenes were very good. At the same time, the disco scene, the scene shot from above, looked very epic. I was blown away by these scenes. The ending of the movie was a bit simplistic so the ending was disappointing.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick chapter 4 is without a doubt, the greatest ever action movie of our lifetime. The film, which runs at two a half hours, is relentless. 90% of this film is action, it barely gives you any time to breathe before moving on to the next fight.<br><br>And the action sequences themselves, are with out a doubt the best I've ever seen. Spanning multiple locations, we have insane gun fights, swordplay, hand to hand, car chases; even archery and as we've come to expect from Chapter 3, some dog killing sequences.<br><br>The story is actually pretty solid, with the only negative of the movie being the cheesey one liners from every character; but actually, I don't even mind - we know this is supposed to be fun and not take itself too seriously, and whilst Keanu himself in my opinion delivers his lines with incredible averageness, it almost adds to the movie. The sets themselves are also gorgeous, taking us from Japan to France, and not once are you disappointed with the scenery.<br><br>If you're a fan of action sequences, strap yourself in for the most incredible experience you'll ever have.</div>

For the last 3 Wicks, every decision just brought him back to square one. Its an endless loop. A writers nightmare when you dont have a story that progresses.<br><br>Where this really shines is the cinematography, and fight choreography. Stunning work by the everyone on the crew. Pretty amazing the type shots they were able to get in and had some really good one shots. The fights scenes are awesome but just kinda got old when the movie is nearly 3 hours long.<br><br>Entertaining film... would def say it was worth the money.</div>

With the introduction of a few martial arts Legends the movie took the series to the next level.<br><br>The creative Geniuses behind some of those long single shot fight sequences deserves a hats off. A couple of them really stand out. One overhead shot of John Wick running from room to room fighting his enemies And the other with John Wick, Donny Chen and group fighting in a room filled with art pieces made of bulletproof glass.<br><br>The climax was one to behold as well.<br><br>On the whole it was a fun John Wick experience with a lot of entertaining fight sequences that makes it worth your money and time. And if you are a John Wick fan, this was what you were waiting for, and it's not going to disappoint you.</div>

I can't find anything negative about this movie. Every detail is great from bottom to top. Isometric scenes are so clever, insane and perfect. Maybe the scenario is not much deep but you don't even notice it as you watch it with your eyes wide open and breath deep. Music is amazing, sounds are awesome, action never stops until the end, scenes are very artistic , and the cast is very good. Probably I will see it again soon. Maybe I see it third time too. God I can't wait to see it again.</div>

When seeing an action movie you don't anticipate this level of cinematography, visuals, acting, and ultra-stylized set pieces and locals. Let alone the fight choreography, stunts, and effects work. This movie also invents new open lens tracking sequences with a crane that have never been used and many will try and duplicate in the future as it elicits a brand new audience viewpoint and sensory experience. It lacks a bit in structure, and some scenes might be just a little too long, but that's ticky tacky. This movie is pure fun and continues to the raise the bar, shockingly, for not only the John Wick series but also the action genre itself. Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves deserve all the credit for this.<br><br>Top Genres - Action, Crime, Thriller

Keanu continues to own the John Wick role. Donnie Yen bringing all his skills to the table. This sequel just ramps up everything this franchise represents. A Clean, sleek, modern action flick. This film is a masterclass of peak cinema. The set pieces are on another level. Insert more praise. This is the one. Definitely recommend checking this out. The cinematography alone is worth a watch. Real locations. The set design. It's peak. It's everything you want out of a movie.</div>

The fight scenes were just so cool, but I did think they lasted a little too long, and there is no way someone is walking away from what John Wick went through in all of it. It did run wayyyy too long on all of the fight scenes even tho they were great. I loved all the actors. This is just one of those great action movies that just hit the spot for me. The dog was a fun addition, and I assume that the person with the dog will show up again in future movies. I highly recommend this movie if action is your thing. Great fun.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Escapism in its finest, of action, martial arts, assault weapons and over the top survival, dominance and destruction. Great directing, acting, pacing, choreography and simple, but effective plot. The lore of the mythical history of the John Wick criminal universe is a well done and told in simplicity to provide enough interest and understanding.<br><br>Depending on your mood when you watch this, it may seem a tad too long of a movie, but if you are a fan of this genre, there is enough action to keep you happy.<br><br>Sound track is great and there is a music video and stylistic vibe to the filming. As always in a John Wick movie, in most action scenes, John Wick is almost indestructible and "lucky". The ensemble of old and new lead actors/characters deliver and synergize well in making their performance engaging and exciting.<br><br>Leave reality and logic behind for awhile and go watch this movie for a wonderful rollercoaster ride.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">5 out of 5 stars.<br><br>John Wick Chapter 4 is an awesome neo noir action thriller film that gets better in each sequel. The film continues after the last. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) trying to go after the high table after what happened to the previous film. This sequel is bigger, epic, and action sequences are over the top exciting.<br><br>The films script and story does have a lot of world building with new characters. Like Caine (Donnie Yen), Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), Tracker (Shamier Anderson), Akira (Rina Sawayama), and villain Marquis (Bill Skarsgard). All these characters have a moment to shine. It does provide more interest to the story.<br><br>The film action sequences are exciting and never slows down. It gets wild and edge of your seat. Director does a great job in delivering an action film that is creative and entertains.<br><br>The cast ensemble is great. The music score is awesome. It is one long film but it never slows down and feels fast paced. I am excited to see more sequels. This film does have a great conclusion to the series without giving away spoilers. It tied everything down. But it is one franchise that should keep going. Overall, it is one of the best films this year. There is one post credit scene that is worth checking out.</div>

Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version. The rabble, ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy. John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of humour. After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcorn. Kenau Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got millions and what do we do? Portraying human ugliness like it is sexy.</div>

Then, as the body count exceeded what I thought to be roughly 15 thousand souls, I started to feel like I was missing out on life. The feeling grew exponentially, with every batch of 5 thousand casualties.<br><br>When John Wick began his ascent to the top of Sacré Coeur, where he faced a hundred new villains (probably the planet's last surviving human male specimens), I considered leaving. But it was Mr. Nobody yelling his "balls" cormmand (whereupon his dog jumps at a man's crotch, and then urinates over his dead body) that achieved the feat.<br><br>On my way home, I reminisced about the good old days, when an action-loaded, far-fetched but highly entertaining movie could be squeezed into 87 minutes (e.g. Commando, 1985; btw. 51% of the running time of John Wick: Chapter 4).<br><br>Anyway, ChatGPT informs me that "There is no clear evidence to suggest that watching stupid films or any other form of entertainment can significantly lower a person's IQ," so it's not all bad.

                <div class="text show-more__control">I am so happy this movie turned out to be an actual blast firing on all cylinders. Keanu Reeves has never been this good in the series: the stunts and the gravitas he brings to both the character and the film are superb. He and the while team behind the film have been wise enough too to surround him by a whole pack of terrific players (The Blind Man, Mr. Nobody) in order to enhance the experience. There are some breathtaking tracking shots and the main action sequences (Osaka, Germany and Paris) are outstanding. Paris is definitely my favourite. Culminating with a daring, bold surprising ending 'John Wick Chapter 4' is everything you want in a movie now. Go and see it now!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Once a series gets to it's 4th installment - and that installment is NOT a reboot or "prequel" - the audience for said series is pretty much settled in. There is a rabid group of movie-going watchers that are looking for the intimate details and Easter Eggs to further their immersion into this world while the rest of the movie going public has probably moved on and, just might, check it out on a whim.<br><br>Such is the case with JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 - the 4th installment of the Keanu Reeves led/Chad Stahelski Directed series that is long on style, action, intrigue and mythology while being low on logical plot-lines and...well...daylight.<br><br>But this won't matter to the John Wick movie-goer. They are getting more of the same - cartoon violence professionally created by Stahelski and Reeves with plenty of bad guys battling (and losing) to Wick while the mysterious, underground society that Wick has run afoul of tries to take him down.<br><br>This insider intrigue will be enriching for the true John Wick fan but will be inconsequential for the casual movie-goer as these plot machinations are just an excuse to line Reeves up against seemingly insurmountable obstacle after seemingly insurmountable obstacle.<br><br>And what a journey it is. Starting with a tussle at the Osaka Continental (featuring veteran Martial Artists Hiroki Sanada and Donnie Yen) to a battle in Germany to the final in Paris, JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 is just one, long stylized fight sequence with both Stahelski (the Director and Fight Choreographer) and Reeves (as Wick) showing off their talents in new and interesting ways.<br><br>There are way too many fight sequences to mention, but there is one sequence in a building that is shot from on high (reminiscent of watching video game play) that is the most interesting/effective - but they all are a ton of fun.<br><br>Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise the Clown in the IT movies) is along as the Marquis (cool name) who is in charge of bringing Wick down. He is joined by the always good Clancy Brown (the voice of Mr. Krabs on Spongebob) on the "bad guy" side while Wick regulars Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick line up on Wick's side.<br><br>It is a fun roller-coaster ride - if a bit long at almost 3 hours (the middle sags a bit) - that will entertain casual fans of action flicks while satisfying the hard-core "Wick-aphiles" (if that is a term) with a further peeling back of a layer of this world.<br><br>Letter Grade: A-<br><br>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">My weekend ended with finishing the final installment of the John Wick series. I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.<br><br>The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole "tracker" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.<br><br>However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.<br><br>While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as "loving husband" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.<br><br>I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">It's like they thought about how to shoot every type of action scene in its absolute perfection and the most beautiful way, and just went ahead and did it. Almost three hour-long action spectacle that feels non-stop but they do take enough time in between to stop and breathe and those are some genuine breaths using the heart. Even though this and first is my favourite in the franchise, they did stretch the logic to the maximum in this. The way the action works and the world works in this movie felt like it used video game logic, the health bar fills up if you stay still and the NPCs are only scared for a second and go back to what they do if you don't bother them. Nonetheless, this is a theatre experience like none other.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future.. If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves is back again legendery hitman aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinematic experience.. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.. Cinematography is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere from all over the world cinema industries so i know a good action scene when I see it and believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.... Overall don't miss this film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atmos sound you'll spend a quality time....<br><br>AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. 10/10 ..</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">At least this once fine franchise now has a (meh) ending. Tired, stupid, annoying. Only 1 great gunfight (a GLORIOUS top down, exploding shotgun shells, massacre) &amp; 1 good hand-to-hand fight (with an unrecognisable #ScottAdkins), the rest of the action's dull, repetitive, silliness. #KeanuReeves (effective in the other 3 films) here gives a truly appalling performance. He sounds like his batteries are running out, every....word....is....emotionless. His opening scene might THE worst acting seen in cinema history...&amp; he only says "Yeah"!<br><br>.
Where once Wick dodged damage by using his skills to not get hit (&amp; we could genuinely see how he avoided it), now he just brushes off 'Superman' level damage (it's so ridiculous it gets genuinely annoying...from plummeting off buildings, to getting hit by multiple speeding cars, to smashing down 100's of stone steps) that makes EVERY fight pointless (who cares if he gets punched, when bone crushing falls literally do no damage)? Assassins suddenly either don't bother to shoot or punch him when they have a chance, or simply can't hit him even if when he's standing still! But who cares anyway right, when he's now seemingly made of Adamantium!?<br><br>.
And why tediously rehash "Rogue One" by making #DonnieYen blind again? Worse, it just adds to the annoying stupidity. That a blind swordsman could hear his enemy move, or feel the air moving when a sword strikes, makes (a fantastical) sense. But how does a blind man dodge getting shot by multiple gunmen standing 20-30 feet away? Can he 'hear' the direction a gun is pointing? What utter nonsense. In fact he's so not effected by being blind...why make him blind?!<br><br>.
There's also a sorry lack of links to the other 3 films. You could watch this &amp; fully understand most of it. Bar Fishburne, Reddick &amp; McShane no characters return &amp; even the shocking betrayal by #IanMcShane in "3" (including shooting Wick off a building) is completely ignored by the plot AND Wick! He's just back to being a friend &amp; ally again as if nothing happened. Hell, even the damn dog gets ignored!<br><br>.
The fact is if "3" had a better final 3rd with a satisfying ending we would've had a truly great action franchise trilogy. As it is the entire bloated finale &amp; garbage non-ending of "3" seemed to doom the franchise UNLESS a (money-grabbing) "4" could perform a miracle...But as we know, miracles rarely happen.<br><br>Best just stick with "1" then now.</div>

And believe me I was not disappointed though a bit slow paced at the beginning the moment John Wick start on a killing spree the action sequences, gunfights are so good and satisfying that it kept me to the edge of the seat and willing to cheer him for every enemy he takes down. Donnie yen, Scott Adkins, Hiroyuki Sanada were icing on the cake.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.<br><br>What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like "City Of Lost Children" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.<br><br>Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.<br><br>Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from "No Time To Die" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.<br><br>Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.<br><br>Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.<br><br>This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.<br><br>This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">After so many unnecessary movies and series that flattered all segments that did everything for the sake of being watched , you really came out for a wonderful series The BOOGEYMAN as JOHN WICK.<br><br>Being. An ardent fan since the release of the first one , I've been cautious going into each subsequent film. Waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise .This movie did the exact opposite . Waaaay over the top action , infused with a lot more humour and tongue-in-cheek sequence , this movie deliver . So much so , i was disappointed.....at the last and more disappointed about not coming John Wick 5...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">After the pleasant success John Wick was, the creators somehow managed to made their magnum opus John Wick 2, the best one by far, where the whole idea of the unstoppable legendary assassin gets fully realized.<br><br>In this movie, however, just like in the last one they tried making the action more bombastic by giving the villain "all the power in the world", not only overcomplicating the whole lore of the assasins guilt (once again) but also turning the whole action of the movie into a cartoonish mess.<br><br>Once again the Baba Yaga gets turned into a damage sponge who keeps just walking off been thrown off high buildings, getting run over, punched and hit with multiple objects and still winning every fight by the power of deus ex machina.<br><br>The pacing of the action is just horrible, every 5 minutes there's a random fight and Wick keeps barely making it out alive but they keep expecting you take this crap seriously! Forget how awesome and practical gun-fu was in the first film, this time everyone has magical bullet proof clothing that just makes the fights longer and the whole choreography less believable.<br><br>There are a couple of great cinematic and tense scenes (I specifically loved the sword fight NOT involving Wick and the scene where the camera is on the ceiling inside the abandoned building). Sadly there's a ton of things I hated: the almos 3 hour duration, the whole retcon and rush to stablish a new villain, the weak motivations gor said villain, the blind guy with superpowers, the needless "tracker" guy and his dog, the amount of random and long fighting scenes that just kept going and kept happening... So bad.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic Blonde.<br><br>I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along. The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.<br><br>It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 49 minutes.<br><br>I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">So.... I thought I loved JW. I certainly love the first one. Imo, the first JW is one of the best action movies of all time. It was a story with heart - it had a reason for being. And I realized about myself, what I love most in a movie are the parts where you a) discover the protagonist's "powers" b) learn about a new world and 3) real people doing extraordinary things. That was my JW, the Baba Yaga. A legend brought back to life because someone stole his car and took his dog. Perfection.<br><br>Fast forward till now and over hours of my life, JW has eroded into some kind of cartoon. The man should be in a full body cast at all times but no, he just bounces around like a rubber ball, seemingly mad at himself at certain points because he keeps getting back up. The premise of JW is that he's an extraordinarily TALENTED man - not Wolverine - yet he is now a superhero. And much of this movie didn't make sense - why wasn't his rage directed at Winston?!? He was the one who betrayed him in the 3rd movie. His reasons for all his actions aren't compelling at all any more....in reality, if he's THIS MAD he should be going after the cancer research centers that didn't save his wife.<br><br>If all that you ever loved about JW is the shooting, well, this will be your jam. There's plenty. But...it's not good. Not like the OG. Sigh.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">It begins right at where chapter 3 ended, and John still trying to make the high table understand he wants to be left alone. And within a couple of minutes happens the only logical thing and bodies start piling up.<br><br>Without going into specifics you see stuff happen to the NYC Continental and the Bill Skarsgård character recruiting, more like forcefully dragging one of John's old friends in order to get the job done, and at the same time we're introduced to the Tracker character that has a cute malinois with him because we know how much this franchise love dogs.<br><br>THE ACTION
Set pieces are insanely paced and the movie never lift the foot off the gas that even though the movie has almost 3 hours you won't feel it at all. The whole chase in Paris has John dispatching henchmen with ease drifting around and dodging oncoming traffic as the High Table price on his head increases pulling even more assassins. There's an scene inside a house after that with an overhead shot that makes it look like a video game and the whole theatre was laughing at how John moved around using walls for cover and using dragon's breath shotgun shells (not a spoiler as it was in many trailers).<br><br>It's not every day that we see a franchise get better with each film, specially with a sleeper hit in 2014 that was my favourite film of that year with reason. Watch this movie in the biggest screen available and don't go for a large drink because even though it doesn't feel like it's 3h long, otherwise you'll be very uncomfortable before the credits.</div>

The Outlandish And Super Cool Characters, that Ending 👌. This was it.<br><br>Saw this in IMAX and to be Honest, this is no Longer a John Wick Movie. It's Turned Into Something Else.<br><br>This Movie also seemed like a Show of Set-pieces rather than a Narratively Driven Movie.<br><br>That Being said, I had a Great Time with this Movie.<br><br>Things I liked about John Wick 4 -<br><br>1. The Cinematography, Lighting and Costume Design were Beautiful to Look At.<br><br>2. The Dragons Breath Birds Eye View Scene was Very Good.<br><br>3. The Circular Gun Drive-By Car Scene was Astonishing to Watch and was Such a Good Scene.<br><br>4. The Circular Fights with Cars Driving By was Also a Good Part of That Scene.<br><br>5. The Blind Guy, at times, has Some insane Hand Speed with that Sword and Fists.<br><br>6. The Staircase Scene was Ridiculous but it was Shot Beautifully and Again, it Was Fun.<br><br>7. I really liked the Gold Teeth Purple Suit Guy and the Poker Game they Had.<br><br>8. The Russian Woman was Dripping with Coolness, The Raven Slick Back Hair, The Neck Movements and Mannerisms, the Beautiful Jewellery, She was Super Cool<br><br>9. The Club Fight Scene was Ridiculous but it Looked Good. Again this Movie Felt like a Show.<br><br>10. I didn't Know how they would end the Third Act. The way The Ending Duel Panned Out, and the Laugh from "Mr Nobody" was a Nice Touch. 👌<br><br>11. Some of the Fist Fights and Combat Fights were Good. Some Great Hand Speed 👍<br><br>Possible Problems People Would Have -<br><br>1. If You are Looking for Story, this isn't it.<br><br>2. If You are Looking for Furthering of Characters, this isn't it.<br><br>3. If you are Actually Looking For a John Wick movie, this isn't it.<br><br>Overall, John Wick 1,2 &amp; 3 is a Great Trilogy, 2&amp;3 Are my Favourites. John Wick 4 Seems Like a John Wick From One Of the Multiverses. However, I did Enjoy it, John Wick 4 is a Moments Based Movie, Sort of like a Show, it has Some Good Combat, Good Action at Times and a Couple of Astonishing Moments, Specifically the Circle Drive-By Gun Scene from Wick.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I love the John Wick movies. They are unapologetically badass. Suspension of disbelief is required, but if you submit yourself to the experience, it's a ride unlike any other in modern cinema.<br><br>This film is truly everything great about the first 3 films turned up to 11. The story, tho somewhat secondary to the action/cinematography, is a fitting fourth chapter to this saga. The new characters are the best to be introduced yet out of all the films. Caine, Akira, Mr Nobody and his dog; they are interesting, exciting, mysterious, and above all, badass.<br><br>The star of the show however is obviously the fight choreography and the cinematography. It's what makes this film. Like the others, this film is drenched in neon style and is clearly influenced by Bladerunner and the like. It's amazing. The long shots, the still shots, the camera angles (that one long bird's eye scene, wow) the lighting. This is truly more than just an action movie. There's an appreciation for elevated filmmaking and the art of film that is on full display here. It's "elevated action" if you want to come up with a genre.<br><br>The fight choreography is unsurprisingly perfect. The amount of jaw dropping kills was ridiculous. You know when someone is just so absurdly cool you can't help but laugh out loud? Every extended fight scene had handfuls of these moments. Scorsese famously stated that the marvel films weren't cinema, they were amusement rides. I know he was offering a jab, but this film to me was the best of both world. I felt like I was riding a ride at an amusement park, blown away by the views at the top, and laughing at the excitement of the more exhilarating parts.<br><br>Fantastic movie, probably the best action film of the 21st century (yes, better than mad max) and an achievement of making just a damn enjoyable movie. 10/10, A+, 5 stars, the whole shebang.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I have to say that the only John Wick film that I've really liked before this one is the original. The two sequels that followed we're good but 8 wasn't as impressed as I was with the first one. Also, the 3rd one felt to bloated. It was all over the place.<br><br>So what about John Wick 4? It is no doubt the best since the original. I would say even better. When I saw the long runtime u thought it would be too long and dragged out but what Keanu Reeves and durector Chad Staheski have put together one of the most exciting action movies to come out in a very long time. They went for broke here. As far as story, that has never been the strong suit of this franchise anyway but again John Wick wants his freedom from The High Table and everyone is out to stop him. What makes this film so enjoyable is how comfortable Keanu Reeves is in the role and ll8ndont know how much of the stunt work he actually died but he goes all out here. The fight and gun choreography is on a level that is now the new standard. These days action films are so full 9f CGI that they feel.like animation really. I'm sure that this film has CGI in many spots but there is a great amount of terrific stunt work done here. The action is fast, and somewhat exhausting at times but done in a way that has you glued to the screen!!!<br><br>Best action film in a long time!!!<br><br>Grade: A-</div>

But forget that. This is the best John Wick ever.<br><br>This is very close to perfection within the potentialities of this expanded Universe. Set pieces are more impressive than ever - I don't even know which one to mention! -, incredible choreography, funny moments, exciting and well-built new characters and a world on steroids that seems to have no end. Reeves with a more characteristic John Wick than ever - although sometimes his reactions resemble those of Roy Kent in...Ted Lasso -, incredible scenarios and locations, beautiful photography and an excellent soundtrack. There's an interior scene all shot top-down that is magnificent!<br><br>In technical terms, a hymn to the cinema. Super entertaining.<br><br>PS: Skarsgärd's accent is one of the worst in cinema history.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">After a pretty pathetic JW3, this sequel does deliver. JW3 suffered from boring and repetitive fight scenes: it seemed like a video game where headshot quantity was important. I literally fell asleep around 90 min in. JW4 recovers nicely, and is definitely worth seeing. A much better plot, with great and well-choreographed fight scenes. The spice is back. And great, aggressive cinematography, too. Eye candy, with attractive on location shots from Berlin and Paris. Yes, there is the obligatory empowered female fighter, but her role is limited to killing only 10-12 300 lb mercenaries. And the obligatory white male villain, but good news! He's French! So we can despise him regardless of sex or ethnicity. Of course it's not a JW sequel unless the laws of physics are suspended, but if you buy the premise, you'll buy the gag. Worth the watch.</div>

The stunts were ballistic... a few logical flaws but it's a cult classic for sure. Should have trimmed the running length though. What started with a dog has got a fitting farewell after 4 installments. John and his charisma steals the show. Unexpected performance from Donnie. A benchmark has been set with Cinematography. The aerial shots fight sequence reminded me of GTA 1 and 2. Keanne has done full justice to his role. Worth a watch. Hope the makers would reboot the storyline with a new character in the future.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">9/10. I don't know how they did the impossible. Somehow the fourth entry in the John Wick saga is the best one. This movie has no right being as good as it is. Seriously, this film has some of the best action sequences, gun play, hand to hand combat, and practical effects seen in a while. The action/fight sequences are done in long takes, gleefully violent, gracefully over the top, relentless pandemonium, and a complete assault on all the senses. It's pure, unadulterated mayhem and fun.<br><br>The cinematography is gorgeous to look at with awesome shots thrown in. Biggest complaint is the movie is a little too long; almost three hours. But that goes by quite quickly even though it just drags in a couple of scenes. The fight choreography is something Jackie Chan would be very of to make. Keanu Reeves does a great job with his fight scenes and he is pushing fifty but acts like he is in his twenties. Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from "It") pulls off a sadistic villain mixed in with great performances from Donnie Yen (his character is blind but still kicks ass) and Shamier Anderson with his beloved mutt.<br><br>It's not quite a masterpiece; but delivers a pure, adrenaline filled cinematic experience. The coolest sequence is the birds eye view of the fire dragon breathing shotgun shootout. The stunt team also deserves a big shoutout. Definitely go see this on the big screen and heavily suspend your disbelief. Then sit back and enjoy the frenetic, over the top, blood soaked ride.</div>

Every fight scene (and there is a lot of them) takes place in the most gorgeous places with stunning almost otherworldly lighting. The cinematography is insanely good and a treat for the eyes. Choosing the action set pieces to take place in Osaka to Berlin to Paris gives the feeling that you as the spectator are being taken on a journey, thereby justifying the almost 3 hour run time. Donnie Yen's character; Cain and The Tracker are instant fan favourites and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future. A fantastic film with a satisfying ending that leaves nothing to be desired. Well done to everyone involved. 10/10.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.<br><br>Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotel Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.<br><br>Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.<br><br>What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.<br><br>Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I didn't expect much when John Wick hit theatres in 2014. I was shocked at how much fun I had with that film though and have enjoyed Chapters two and three almost just as much. The action has always been the reason to see these films and Keanu Reeves just being Keanu Reeves? C'mon, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than that. Well, John Wick: Chapter 4 has just hit theatres and it's not just my favourite John Wick film, it's one of my favourite straight-up mainstream action films in years. Here's why, especially if you've enjoyed the previous three, this one is a must-see.<br><br>Picking up relatively soon after the events of John Wick: Chapter 3, we see John Wick has pretty much recovered after an impossible feat at the end of that third film. He learns how to get to the High Table and also how he can be freed of being a wanted and hunted man, but new foes and many new armies will stop at nothing to take him down before he accomplishes that task. That's pretty much it for the plot, even though much more happens throughout the film that I will not spoil here. Without wasting any time though, I have to say that this film pulls no punches in its action or story for that matter. This is easily the most intricate story and the greatest action this franchise has given us yet.<br><br>At a run time that closes in on three hours, I never felt it. Every 20-30 minutes this film dives into action sequences that last a good 20 minutes each. On top of that, I have to commend the cinematography by Dan Laustsen, because this is some of the best-filmed action scenes I've seen in years. Yes, there are times when it starts to feel excessive, but that's usually right about the time that those sequences are concluding. The action never felt like it overstayed its welcome this time around. The action feels like a lot, but it also feels more sparse due to the long run time.<br><br>In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 does a great job furthering this story, expanding on the mythology, and giving us somewhat of a conclusion to this franchise. I'm not sure where a fifth film could go from here. I've enjoyed the overdone performance by Keanu Reeves throughout the entire franchise and that is only accentuated here. Yes, as most of these films go, I've had issues with the screenplay in terms of the simplistic dialogue, but I honestly feel that it's just intentional at this point and therefore it made me enjoy this one even more. If a silly, well-crafted action flick can be a near-masterpiece, I'll say this comes close, but with a few minor issues. I loved watching this film.</div>

Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie. This franchise eclipses Tom Cruise and the Mission films. A+ film.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Choreography in cinema has long been associated with depiction of story, visual and dance. But for one of the first times this movie has presented a new method of action choreography, this movie will serve as a template of action movies to come for decades.<br><br>With a steady camera, constant movement, multiple camera angles, repeated use of body posture just as a ballet dance would, the director and choreographer have been able to merge together gun fight, sword play and human body movement into an amazing masterpiece.<br><br>The movie contains no frills no time wasting no fillers no nonsense, the intermission arrives before you know it. You are on the edge of your seat, begging, asking for more, unknowing of what is to come.<br><br>The director has used his 20+ years of action direction and experience to culminate into a new genre that has given the much needed action genre a breath of fresh air. Using Karate, taekwondo, gun combat, old school pistol duel, samurai sword duel, god the number of different martial schools used in this 2hrs and 50mins of mind blowing action is a true testament to the directors experience, where he holds no cards to his chest and lays it all on the table.<br><br>The earlier John Wick movies were themselves a huge yardstick to measure quality and progress, but this one the director and Mr. Reeves has taken it to the next level. Kudos to everyone who has contributed to making this movie. You have made my day and this movie will be in my heart and mind for a long long time.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I must admit, I had a fair share of concerns about John Wick: Chapter Four as the release date slowly approached, but I am happy to report that every ounce of hype you may have heard about this film is warranted, and in some cases, is underselling this film.<br><br>There are many new characters we are introduced to in this film, and every single one is such a joy to watch. The standout in this department is Donnie Yen, who is phenomenal as Caine; a standard we've come to expect from such a legend in the industry. And of course, our returning characters are all still delightful in this film.<br><br>John Wick: Chapter Four is one of the most ambitious action films I've ever seen in every aspect. The choreography, pacing, cinematography, production design, blocking are all immaculate. This film is the pinnacle of the franchise; a franchise that is rightfully regarded as among the greatest of the genre. There isn't a dull moment, from start to finish.<br><br>The runtime may seem daunting initially, but this epic continuation of the narrative truly had me at the edge of my seat with each new sequence. This is the most beautifully shot and choreographed film of the franchise. The film also delivers on the intended emotions throughout. After following John on this journey for four films, we vicariously are as exhausted, triumphant, and fulfilled by the film's conclusion.<br><br>Chapter Four rivals not only every recent smash-hit film; stands amongst the greatest action films of all time. Truly, all of the hype is warranted. Why are you even still reading this? Go watch it already!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Hmmm. Difficult to sum up No 4 as clouded by the previous three which were superlative, is this really a modern western in disguise?. It has all the ingredients for conflict,redemption,revenge,resolution,however the new characters, with classic kung fu,versus the European heavies in tight shiny suits don't get you hating the bad guys, just another line of targets to clear.<br><br>The great thing about the previous productions is the viewer is invested in the main characters we're familiar with, and what happened to Wick's dog? Just a series of set pieces knitted together indoors and outside in different cities, there is no subtlety, knock 'em down ! Next !<br><br>There is a sequence where viewed from above third person view ,emulating a PC game, a satire on the gaming generation? Also some of the post release interviews there is a score card on how many times a stunt double had been killed.<br><br>The redeeming part of the film is Wick's backstory and origin family.<br><br>It is a long film two hours and forty minutes, probably better to stream and pause occasionally, to rest from violence overload.</div>

Even my wife, who usually watches Lifetime movies and hasn't seen John Wick 1-3, enjoyed it and now wants to see the first three films. Great cast too! Not as much humor as the first three classic films but the pace and story made an almost three hour movie go quickly. We will definitely watch part four several times. Thank you Keanu Reeves for another great movie. Movies like this must be seen in a theater and will help the movie industry recover from several weak years of sub-par movies (other than Top Gun 2)!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Coming in the 4 installment of the John Wick series with everything that has happened in the previous 3 I was wondering what was going to happen in this one. And boy it was magnificent. Keanu Reeves had already solidified himself as a legend through the Matrix series but with the conclusion of this movie he overcame whatever he did while acting as Neo. The choreography was the best I've ever seen in any action movie and it never felt boring. For a movie almost 3 hours long it never got boring you were always hyped up about what's going to happen next. The camera work was phenomenal following Wick to iconic places such as Japan, Sahara Desert(probably),Paris,Berlin,New York etc. But what I really appreciated about this movie was that despite having less dialogue than action you really had feelings about the other characters than John. Caine's character (Donnie Yen) was tremendous at his job. He made himself a believable blind men without making his character such as Daredevil. When you first saw you him you instantly hated him but with the movie progressing you started to like him. Marquis (Bill Skasgard) gave you the vibe of a hateful villain from the start and keeping that vibe irritating you through the whole movie. The tracker (Shamier Anderson) was a fun character also being more a anti-hero than a villain giving us memories from the first John Wick with his dog. And the comeback of some iconic characters such as Charon,Winston and King. And in the end a very sad but also nice conclusion with the villain ending up dead Caine and his daughter being saved and John finally resting joining his wife in the afterlife and making himself the name of the most notorious person in the underworld. The Babayaga!<br><br>And movie to be remembered through the years.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick 4 is not just the best film of the franchise but undeniably one of the greatest action films of all time. Despite it's lengthy runtime being felt at points, the action set pieces out do each other with every passing minute. We might have witnessed the greatest action scenes in film history.<br><br>Keanu Reeves has once again proven why he is up there with Tom Cruise as one of the greatest actors in the action genre. With each decade he continues to deliver and doesn't seem to slow down. The use of music in the movie is second to none. The beauty of John Wick is that it's unapologetically maximalist and unlike the MCU films which is scared to take itself seriously, John Wick 4 believes it's hype.<br><br>It will be criminal to deny this movie accolades for cinematography, editing and sound. Chad gives us a fitting conclusion for the John Wick saga. The fight scene in Osaka never gets tiring and raises the stake by every kill, which is metamorphic to the entire franchise.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is the conclusion to the franchise. John sets out to prepare for his war against the High Table, and be free from all this once and for all. However, the job isn't going to be an easy one and all those close to him are caught in the crosshairs and old friends turned rivals are involved in the matter. John wicks' chapter 4 is nothing short of an epic action if the term can apply to action films. Its film it's ushering a fresh light on the genre from its stunts to the fight choreography and high tension. Which continues throughout these movies including this one. The chapter is by all means the best out of the four films since the first. It sets up the situation and throws you off on this thriller of a ride. With the 4th film, not much can be said that hasn't been said about the previous installments. Action is amazing fast paced, and excellent stunt work. Great performance from the cast Keanu Reeves you know him you love as John, Ian McShane, and The late Lance Reddicks. The new cast while Parabellum did a good job of setting up the grand finale. It didn't have the most interesting dialogue. The Adjudicator this woman was not at all interesting and took away a lot of the awe and charm of the mystery of the Table. Here was given Bill Skarsgård as The Marquee. He carries more than a traditional shadow figurine showing that this is a guy who has a lot of power calm and is calculated but won't lift a finger and do his dirty work. He's a face you can love to hate So are the side characters Donnie Yen is arguably the best character in the film as he plays a blind swordsman named Cain. He has his reason for wanting john dead, but in many, he's conflicted on the matter. Some of the more somber moments of the film between him and John are compelling. And of course, he's a badass. Fast and on his feet, kind of out stages John in some scenes. They do a very great job and creative ways of showing how he fights.s There's also another guy after John simply called Mr. Nobody who doesn't have any Vendetta against John. He's just a guy trying to collect on John's head., but he's so frequent in the movie and when he's now on screen with his dog he's a charming guy. The visuals are stunningly beautifully shot very well-lit, amazing camera angles. There's one shootout with an overhead view and it's a straight-up video game it's awesome. The only cons that could be made about the movie are the run time. Unlike Parabellum where it just got so carried away with the action that it started to become desensitizing. And the between scenes were lackluster. Here it trying to wrap up the series your gonna want to go all out. Conclude Character arcs and all that. So it's understandable, and I have so invested in the film that it didn't bother me personally. Overall if you enjoy the last 3 films you'll love this story.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.<br><br>From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.<br><br>In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsgård, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.<br><br>It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.<br><br>Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.<br><br>There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.<br><br>The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.<br><br>But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.<br><br>This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.<br><br>10/10 - John wick Chapter 4 is a a modern day classic.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick's story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don't go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.</div>

First n all the main credit goes to the director of this film CHAD STAHELSKI. From movie story, screenplay, action sequences, choreography and to present the world of John Wick and all the characters in one frame is not an easy job. The way this movie describes the action stunts and sequences is like never before seen. What a dedication to make this real. No one can perform JOHN WICK'S character better than KEANU REEVES. He's the soul of the film and the way he has given the outstanding performances in every chapter is totally worth it. From Chp 1 to Chp 4 his journey is still the same and he hasn't age a bit. But what a way to end his journey and the saga completely satisfied. The way director has build the world of john wick is just phenomenal. Can't wait for Ballerina. Don't listen to anyone just go and experience the Unimaginable Action sequences it'll blow your mind specially last 40 mins is a treat. Even if you had never seen last 3 chp still go and enjoy the action sequences. This movie is exciting as well as emotional for John Wick fans because the Saga is come to an end. The one and only " BABA YAGA "</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Gave me another reason to hate the French, phenomenal film. My dislike for the french began at a young age when i found out that France existed and they had the same rights as the regular person. This movie contained the exceptionally villainous character of Marquis played to perfection (or as near to it as a french man can get) by the non-french actor Bill Skårsgard. Bill's performance was legendary and will not soon be forgotten by avid enjoyers of the john wick franchise, nor by avid haters of the french. The Marquis being the main enemy of the movie really emphasised the evil of the french population and how they can be evil. However not all french individuals are evil, for example the rat, remy, in ratatouille is a stand up guy and the chef gusteau from the same movie was also a great guy and the imaginary version in remy's mind was an impeccable character. However i still regard the french as lesser men because i have a "friend" who is descended from french men and he's annoying, like a French man.<br><br>So overall i rate john wick chapter 4 a 10/10
Ratatouille is a 9/10.</div>

This entry is no exception. And they've not only upped the action of the previous entries in this franchise, but they've singlehandedly outclassed every other movie in the genre at the same time.<br><br>Just the three action sets pieces toward the final 90 minutes of the film blow every other film in the genre out of the water. I'm still in awe and headed back to IMAX for a second viewing.<br><br>For action fans, believe the hype... it doesn't get any better than this.</div>

The result was just as I expected. It was just the same as Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or "franchise" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some turns to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it would be still enjoyable, but it's too late to stop this "cliche train" starting from John Wick chapter 3, Nobody, Bullet Train, Violent night, and this John Wick: Chapter 4. I don't think this franchise will die any time soon. They are probably working another movies in John Wick universe right now.</div>

Paris scene was a bit chaotic, to me it felt a bit too blatant. It's supposed to be a secret society. In previous titles when Wick fights off killers it's been mostly discrete, or at least they try if I remember correctly. NOT IN PARIS. Swarm of killers just hunt Wick openly, might as well do it in broad daylight. Kinda break immersion if you ask me. Also, I'm not sure what's the purpose of the existence of Mr. Nobody, it's an interesting character for sure but felt a bit out of place. The writings failed to incorporate him and elevate him to plot significance. The movie would work with or without him, such a pity because I really like the character, he has a lot of potential to be greater. Last but not least, the main antagonist is just some typical spoiled brat, don't get me wrong the acting was on point, but the character himself is kinda boyish and weak, not a charismatic and strong antagonist I hoped for. Overall great action movies, all the cultures, guns, killings, and bonds are intriguing. Giving it a 9/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Need I say more?<br><br>Well because of imdb's 600-character minimum requirement here, I'll oblige.<br><br>"John Wick Chapter 4" is a spectacle of Keanu Reeves gracing the big screen with the nonstop backdrop of one beautiful cinematography after another. The first action sequence happens several minutes into the film and you wonder, this is nice, but where is Reeves? Could he be making the extras pull the weight this time instead of doing the action himself? Well nothing could be further from the truth! Once switched on, Reeves delivers immensely, leans in with total commitment, and is an awe to behold. You come here for fabulously choreographed fight sequences, and that is exactly what you get. Long, intricate, and entertaining. The blind man fight scenes are especially superb which is no surprise because we are treated to Ip Man himself, thanks Donnie Yen! Bravo for everyone involved. It is apparent that they put their heart and soul into this! Oh, and check out Rina Sawayama's singing career. What a voice and star power. She gives off Lady Gaga vibes.</div>

The cinematography is stunning to say the least, and the action is everything you could possibly want! Every character in this movie was brilliant and executed with the upmost, talent and charisma! I cannot wait to watch chapter 4 again and again and again! I truly believe that this franchise is by far the best action franchise ever created! Thank you, Chad and Keanu for creating a masterpiece. Chapter 4 nailed it, and I could not be any more proud of the production team for creating this world for all of us to live in and enjoy.</div>

This film will set example for current and upcoming generation like Terminator 2 and Die hard was to us. I've seen so many classic and critically acclaimed films from all over world. This is what we needed. Totally worth my time and scene points. Must be watched on screen as much big as possible..</div>

After watching Parabellum, and slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken after seeing this film. The IMAX experience was breathtaking and impactful, so if given the opportunity, definitely don't miss out. But, watching it in a regular cinema is also equally good. While I don't want to spoil, I find that the movie felt way shorter than it's 2h 49m runtime, as I felt that Parabellum felt around 20 minutes too long. So if runtime worries you, I can assure you that it is not a problem, but a positive.<br><br>The movie left me highly satisfied and breathless, so massive props and respect to everyone involved in superseding the other entries and reinvigorating the action genre. It really feels like a once in a lifetime example of a genuinely impactful action movie. Please watch it and I feel that a 10 is worthy simply because of enjoyable nature, which the movie leans into. It does everything an incredible movie needs, and easily makes it one of the best movies as of late, and the apex of this amazing franchise! Also props to Keanu Reeves for inhabiting this character as well, as nobody brings it like him.</div>

I love John Wick 1-3 and saw all three of them 2-3 times in theatres, with more repeat viewings at home.<br><br>John Wick 4 is an awful mockery of everything that made the franchise good. It is far too long and overindulgent - some filler shots go on for 20-30 seconds when they could have been 5 - and the movie lacks the kinetic realism of all the previous entries. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and even unnecessary at times, and plot is completely nonsensical.<br><br>WHY does he drive in circles around the Arc de Triomphe when he could just drive Montmarte? He later drives the motorcycle there...<br><br>How is the Eiffel Tower the closest the Bowery King can get him to Montmarte? That's where he was right before that!!<br><br>Ugh, and don't get me started on the Marquis nonsense. It's the worst kind of one-up-manship - illogical, unfounded, and a pure plot contrivance.<br><br>Hard pass.</div>

It's smooth, slick, fast, beautifully put together and keeps you entertained for almost the full 2.5 hours (which is quite long for an action film). Ultimately though, it is just a martial arts film and so if long fight scenes aren't your thing you're probably not going to enjoy this no matter how pretty it is to look at. But if martial arts are your thing, you're in for a visual treat.<br><br>For what it's worth, I personally found the Osaka scene just a little bit too long. The Berlin one was superb and the some of the action in Paris was quite remarkable - notably the scene shot from above which was really excellent. Also the irony that the Parisien drivers on the Arc de Triomphe were far more lethal than 25 men with guns made me laugh! And to go with the stunning visuals is a great soundtrack throughout.<br><br>If action/martial arts are your thing, it's hard to see you not enjoying this movie. And it really is one of those films you need to see on the big screen to appreciate.</div>

For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.<br><br>I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).<br><br>Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.<br><br>I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).<br><br>Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Greetings from Lithuania.<br><br>"John Wick: Chapter 4" (2023) played out the way one could expect from this franchise in term of plausibility. It is unrealistic in every possible way, yet its made in a way that it looks real. And this is the biggest strength of Chapter 4. You have to leave all plausibility at the door before watching it. Because when the movie starts - you are in for one unforgettable ride.<br><br>Not only Chapter 4 is the best from the 4 movies now, it also puts to shame all action films I've seen in many years. Its incredible movie on purely moviemaking terms. Stunt team, choreography of fights, chases and kinetic cinematography are all put in a way I don't think I haven't seen in Hollywood action film yet. I won't spoil anything, but one particular action set piece near the end left me with my jaw dropped - the way it was filmed looked kinda like a video game but so amazing at the same time. Creators really outdone themselves with this film. And action aside (and there is more then enough of it), i loved how confidently this movie was directed.<br><br>Overall, "John Wick: Chapter 4" is the best action film I've seen in many years. Reminded me of "Raid 2" but with bigger scale and way bigger budget. This one has to be seen on big screen - this one incredible action film. And running time almost 3 hours didn't felt draggy - its superbly paced. One of the very best films of the year so far.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">If I were rating this film soley on the fight choreography and cinematography, I would give it an 11/10. Not only is this one of the best looking action films I've ever seen, it also, for the most part, contains the best action setpieces. Watching this film reminded me most of playing a video game. I'm currently playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and even though John Wick isn't a horror movie, the action was most reminiscient of a survival horror experience, with Wick constantly scavenging weapons and ammo from fallen enemies. There's no infinite ammo hacks in the Wick series, and that continues.<br><br>The bigger issue is plot armour, which Wick has in droves. His suit is explained to be made of Kevlar, but no amount of Kevlar justifies the amount of punishment he survives. Also the choreography of one of the minor characters, named Akira, was slightly lacking. She used a bow and arrow and Judo throws, but the enemies she fought were on easy mode compared to Wick's. Don't blame the actress necessarily, she probably just needed a little more practice. Fortunately she was only in one fight scene, and the rest of the action was very fun to watch.<br><br>My other gripe is the story. Every subsequent Wick film escalates both the action, and the plot contrivances to justify the action. The world of John Wick is one where half the population are assassins, and there are no cops. Seriously, the climax of the film is set in Paris, and there are NO COPS ANYWHERE, while Wick is killing droves of people across four different popular landmarks in peak traffic conditions. There's also an office for the Table (or whatever the assassin org is called) in the Eiffel Tower, where a DJ uses barely coded language to tell all the assassins where Wick is going. It's peak silliness.<br><br>I'm not gonna dock too many points for this, but I think it is possible to make a movie that has both top tier action and a comprehensible plot with good worldbuilding. Wick has the former and not the latter. We know that there are good action movies with great resonant plots out there. Stuff like Everything Everywhere shows that it is possible. The Matrix still holds up in this regard too (though the action has aged a little) and maybe the future of this franchise will offer better stories as well.<br><br>In any case, if you want 2 1/2 hours of fantastic action, John Wick 4 continues to deliver.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This movie met every one of my expectations! It delivered with the great action of a typical John Wick action but also had other compelling story lines and the one liners you would expect. The actions scenes are top notch but they always have an undertone of rules and respect that makes it really enjoyable. The lighting was great and even with endless action they still made you really enjoy the characters. The storyline was simple and straight forward but keeps you engaged through out the whole movie. The ending was unpredictable which i really appreciated and I felt keeps me excited. It was not meant to be repetitive and ruin the franchise. It told a story and stuck to the code of the movie. This movie knows exactly what it is and did it 10 out of 10. Amazing.</div>

Only a few films I can call Masterpieces, even my 10/10s or 5/5 stars, I don't typically depict as masterpieces, but this one definitely IS. In every aspect.<br><br>The gun-fu, choreography, fighting, stunts, and action in general. The acting, story was the best of the franchise, and the directing. The cinematography and overall feel of the film. And even other aspects that I would consider at least near masterpiece parts that make the whole, such as the score.<br><br>And watching with an audience made it even better. The reactions to the scenes and the visceral action sequences that took place, made them all the better. Laughing with an audience at perfectly timed comedic moments, and hearing some comments about what's happening on screen; something about a relaxed, chill, and engaging audience just ties a movie together in a nice little bow. The perfect experience one such as myself absolutely LOVES about going to the theater. And it reminds me of one of the main reasons why I go.<br><br>If you get the chance to watch this film at a theater, DO IT. Especially one with a decent amount of audience members. It's a damn good experience that one should NOT miss out on.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I was entertained throughout. The almost three hour run time felt like 20 minutes. Amazing fight sequences, over the top, ridiculous but the film knows that and plays on it. I loved all the films and was a little worried they may have over stretched it with a fourth instalment. I was wrong, it was the icing on the cake. Immensely satisfying and very well filmed. There is an amazing aerial sequence where you see John Wick shoot the bad guys moving through different rooms ( much like a computer game, which I think was its intension). I had the widest smile when it paid a deliberate homage to another classic from the 1970s, The Warriors. If you want Oscar nominated deep and meaningful stuff, this is not for you. If you want an escape from reality and have a great three hours of mindless violence, superb choreography, not much of a story, this is for you. The director has put together a masterclass of an action movie together, the body count alone goes into hundreds and goodness knows how long it took for the actors to do all the stunts. Sheer joy, hugely recommended.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Absolutely one of the best examples of fight choreography, (hand to hand, blade, Judo, Gun-Fu) in films in many many years. Without spoiling anything for those that havent seen it yet, it is an action movie masterpiece. From the opening parlay, to the crescendo. Even including what appeared to be a tongue in cheek commercial for a new Taran Tactical Innovations release lol. Skäarsgäard is stellar at drawing fan heat as the/one of the new bad guy(s). As a huge fan some of the directions of this film and its outcomes leave one to contemplate other entries ideas and/or spin-off opportunities with the loss of one of the best cast members. But, true fans of the Wick series should be more than pleased, I know I was. I was also greatly pleased at the near 3 hour run time, so I wasnt left wanting for material that would require nearly that time, shoved into the usual 90-120 min runtimes to appease to the TikTok generation. Thankfully this fleshed out well and completely. Enjoy folks!</div>

I found it really bland and boring.<br><br>The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.<br><br>It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics.</div>

Absolutely brilliant action sequences, stunning lighting and beautiful cinematography. It has got everything. This movie has taken action movie genre to a whole new level and has earned the Legendary status in my books.<br><br>Chad Stahelski being a stuntman himself has proved why nobody could have directed John Wick better than he did. The locations where action sequences take place are carefully chosen.<br><br>I never write movie reviews but this movie forced me to write my first ever review on IMDB.

Just sit back and enjoy, rid yourself of the remaining little care you have for the world for the moment and witness what John must endure throughout the film that it would automatically drive you to think: "How the hell is he still alive ?". One thing that I found pretty funny about this movie is that it almost feels like a modern console action-adventure game, in which the story involves a side quest that John needs to complete to further the plot and get closer to its completion.<br><br>8.5/10.</div>

The action continues to surprise, the cinematography is visually stunning, the world of assassin's is expanded upon brilliantly, and there are interesting new faces to the franchise that are welcome additions.<br><br>The variety of weapons, locations, and circumstances John Wick is put through help differentiate Chapter 4 (and even the other sequels) from becoming stale or too repetitive. However, like all the sequels before it, it maintains what makes the franchise so special in the first place. If you are a fan of John Wick you will love this sequel. If you're not a fan then your mind will probably not change.<br><br>Chapter 4 will definitely do down as one of the best action movie sequels as well as one of the best movies of 2023. It is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Keanu Reeves, John Wick, and/or the genre itself.</div>

The movie consists of perfect story to action ratio with just perfect timing and execution between the both!<br><br>Reminded me of the old John Wick movies, but with a touch of spice which brought this to a perfect ending possibly.

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.</div>

Absolute perfect way to not only do an action movie but also end the mainline run of a franchise with dignity. All of the original characters have a satisfactory conclusion to their character arcs and even newer characters make you instantly make you wish for a standalone movie to know more about their own story. I feel for all the people waiting for a slow moment in the movie so that they can go to the toilet because those scenes are basically non-existent. The scene elevating this movie from a 9 to 10 for me personally is in Paris when everything suddenly transitions into a top-down view (reminiscent of games like hotline miami). The scene then transitions back into the normal third person view and back again into the top-down perspective. All of this looking like a seamless one-shot. Sure, there were some noticeable green-screen shots towards the end but that didn't make the action shots before any less cool.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is everything you can ask for in an action blockbuster, if I were to sum it up. We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.<br><br>Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!<br><br>Donnie Yen is such a kickass addition to this microcosm, both in terms of delivering high-octane action and playing a character that suits him to the T. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama get to be part of an exciting showdown in Japan, with the latter holding immense potential for the franchise's future. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots. Shamier Anderson and his "faithful accomplice" (a Belgian Malinois, played by five different dogs) are splendid. Also, RIP Lance Reddick (you will be missed!).<br><br>Scott Adkins, as the quirky-yet-menacing Killa, rises to the occasion as a secondary antagonist, with him beating the crap out of Wick in a stunningly stylized set-piece. Bill Skarsgård, playing the arrogant (primary) antagonist, is the ideal final boss. The hybrid score by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all...
To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable 😂).</div>

Almost 3 hours of full action with different action styles in different countries. I have always loved this detail in this series and the previous one. Sometimes you couldn't guess what will happen. Must watch it at a theater.<br><br>John Wick series has written its own name with gold letters in the movie industry. When it is released digitally, I would like to finish all of them. You can feel the connection between the first and last. Sequel names are given as "Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four". These are not a joke. Really a four-part full story.</div>

Only to then again fall back into John Wic's gun-fu exstasy. Like clockwork. On and on. Keanu Reeves, who has maybe 2 pages of dialogue in the entire film series, manages to embody a character that is fascinating, questionable and yet understandable at the same time .<br><br>There's hundreds of action movies.

Last three chapters had some special sachets l set ups and sequences, the stable fight scene and the knife fight in the antique store. That was the genius of the movie, even though you expect it to be a kill fest there was creativity around that preventing it from being repetitive.<br><br>Chapter 4 is just that, pretty much the overdose of the boring sequences from the first 3 chapters.<br><br>The other aspect around how much hits and badgering can John take is also puts this in superhero genre. I mean, he is not captain america for crying out loud.<br><br>The storyline holds well though there are crucial pieces missing. How did he find the elder and was it just to get back the ring? With almost 3 hours duration you expect to cover that. There are lose ends with a daughter's revenge for her father and John wick letting his friend die in vein.<br><br>I feel they could've cut one fight scene to cover these points and competed the movie. This series had done so well to bring continuity all this time just to drop the ball at the end!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is amazing with its acting, action, and story. The story having to do with the ending of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) when John Wick went ex-communicado when Winston shot him off of a balcony, but survived. John Wick must do whatever it takes to talk to the high table into fighting for his freedom to be a free man in Chapter 4.<br><br>Overall, I loved every single minute of the story in this film. There was no slow parts at all and the film keeps on letting the viewer thirst for more action until the end. The choreography was amazing with the amount of action and stunts they did in the film. It was glad seeing returning characters such as John Wick (Keanu Reeves), Winston (Ian McShane), Charon (Lance Riddick, R. I. P), and Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne). Loved the new characters as well such as Caine (Donnie Yen) and Bill Skarsgard's character as the main antagonist. They all did phenomenal acting in their roles to make it one of the best, if not, the best John Wick sequel there is. I would recommend to see John Wick: Chapter 4 in theaters because I am going to watch it for a second viewing!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The film is an action lover's dream. Filled with spectacular gun battles and chase scenes also the magnificent presence of Donnie Yen doing what he does best, overall continuation of the story from episode 3, this film is mostly one man's journey in getting revenge for disturbing his once peaceful existence, his previous life as Hitman or corporate assassin was only a memory until they killed the last living thing he cared about, the they as in his previous employer is now who he is on a mission to destroy completely, while the film is lacking in storytelling, it excels in giving the viewer a very colorful and highly stylized set pieces across several countries, which was quite impressive in my opinion, I also liked the kudo's to the film the Warriors for a particular reference to the DJ and the grandiose finale that had a taste of Sergio Leone spaghetti western sprinkled in for good measure, if there is any time to go back to the theater, well this is the movie to watch, if you are an action film lover, you will not be disappointed with this film.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The fighting scenes are still exciting, the combination of shooting scenes with Keanu Reeves' martial arts is cool as usual, plus there's Donnie Yen who looks really cool in this film. The storyline is actually good, but there are a few things that don't match expectations. The climax of the fourth film is also a bit unfortunate, it's not as exciting as the climax of the third film (Chapter 3 - Parabellum). There are also several characters whose fate is still unclear. It shouldn't be finished in one film in a hurry, but two films can be made so that it gives a clear conclusion for all the characters. That's just my opinion, anyway. Overall, this film is still recommended, especially for those who like the hitman-assassin action genre, you really have to watch it. Hopefully this fourth film will not be the last John Wick film, because I still want to watch Baba Yaga hunting again.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.<br><br>Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsgård tries to make merry off.<br><br>It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene.</div>

It's one of my top 10 favorite movie. Don Y, was classy with many one word, one line jokes. You got Knief, swords, pistols, lots of pistols, tons of pistols, automatic riffle, cars, motor bikes, horse and the best and my favorite was nunchuks. Keanu made it all look real. Can see the level effort he put on the stunt sequence. Came angle from the roof POV was awesome. Fight in steps was mind blowing. Climax was like cherry on top. Not the end end, the one before. Trying to be mindful with no spoilers. Enjoy the movie in iMAX people.</div>

Wow is an understatement.<br><br>Watch it, stay after the credits, you'll not be disappointed. Rarely see someone make the absolute most of every single frame of film but after twice treating myself to viewings, I can say that's been accomplished !!!!<br><br>Even the runtime seemed daunting at first but the pacing is superb and you don't even notice. If I had to absolutely muster up a complaint, my personal one would be the main villain . To be head of the table and know so much, about I'd have pegged him for older.</div>

All of the hand to hand combat scenes, the combatants are in sequential agreement in their movements. It looks awesome, it flows on screen for sure, but it's not realistic.<br><br>This series has always required a suspension of disbelief. This movie even more so.<br><br>At some point John Wick, as if injected now with the blood of Michael Myers in that he has become virtually indestructible.<br><br>In this chapter he endures and withstands the impossible. Not even suffering the slightest sprain, or pulled muscle, much less a broken bone.<br><br>And now we have Kevlar suits which apparently can stop anything and everything and do.<br><br>But what am I saying?<br><br>John Wick fans know this. They know all of this.<br><br>So, this movie gets an 8?<br><br>Yes, because it's John Wick and we love it all no matter what.<br><br>The glorious international settings. The gorgeous mens suits.<br><br>The dastardly villains aplenty.<br><br>Killa played by Scott Adkins is one of my all time faves in this series. An over-the-top, oversized, good toothed comic book-type baddie. He dominates every scene he's in.<br><br>Even as hundreds, maybe even thousands of clubbers get down around he and Wick like it's the mid-90's in some multilevel discotheque thumping away to those bass beats.<br><br>The suits. The sets. The beats. The beatdowns. And Clancy Brown. It's great to see him here too as the Harbinger.<br><br>That's why this film gets an 8. It's a total 8. Is it long? Yes. Does it seem long? No.<br><br>But there is an end scene. A very important one. Stick around for it.</div>

The background, the cam movement everything is perfectly executed In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact his revenge against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the only individual above the High Table.<br><br>Because of this, New York Continental Hotel manager Winston Scott and his concierge, Charon, are summoned to the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a senior member of the High Table, who chastises Winston for his failure to assassinate John. To punish Winston, de Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, has the Continental destroyed, and kills Charon. He then travels to Paris and enlists Caine, a blind, retired High Table assassin and old friend of John's, to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This film is the fourth film from Franchise John Wick and has the longest time of about 169 minutes. The film was directed by the same person and the same main actor namely Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves, as well as newcomers such as Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Lance Reddick, Ian Winston, Rina Sawayama, Scott Adkins and many more. This film tells John Wick who wants to be free from high tables and look for ways to be free from the ex communicado and the only way to fight the high table itself<br><br>Cons:
-Fight Scene that repetitive from the previous film uses the same method and there are some scenes using the same style in fighting it<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Sound that is very supportive of the Cons earlier, the fight scene, every background of the sound is so beautiful and very suitable for fighting or dialogue.<br><br>-Cematography is very beautiful like I play video games. Image drawing in this film is really next level of all other Hollywood action films<br><br>-Ating Donnie Yen here is super cool and stealing the show besides that Keanu Reeves also looks more brutal and crazy as Rina Sawayama whose acting is so cool<br><br>-Storyline is super beautiful and maybe one of the best storyline for the best franchise movie in the action film is very beautiful and great<br><br>-World Building The broad makes this film can explore this franchise further<br><br>-Artistik Fight and Color Grading which is very beautiful makes this film much better than the previous film that distinguishes here the choreographer has a fighting style and art that is really strong so it is different from other action films<br><br>Verdict<br><br>This film is the greatest film John Wick and even the best action in 2023. This film has all the existing aspects ranging from great action sequences, and from the beginning it is already tense which makes this film top notch and help from the sound, editing, cinematography, acting and manuscripts that make this film is a film that is suitable to be watched for lovers Action film and maybe this is the most beautiful work for an action franchise film in the world. (P. S: There is 1 Post Credit Scene that is still connected to the world of John Wick) 😊<br><br>Rating: 10/10<br><br>Reviewed on IMAX Cinemas.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.<br><br>While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.<br><br>Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.</div>

What a screenplay, what a great mouth watering cinematography, what a standard defining Action Scenes. Don't miss this on theaters guys. It has everything to it : Love, Friendship, Brotherhood, Sacrifice, Parenthood, Family, Revenge ( every emotional aspect of a huma life has been challenged here). I can watch this atleast a dozen times more.<br><br>From start to finish, the flow of the story, the character development makes you sit at edge. Suspense was spot on, everything will be there infront us and still we fail to get what's coming. And when you finally arrive at that stake, the story had already been increased the stake before you realise.<br><br>Cinematography, CGI, Action Choreography, Background music everything was spot on.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">If you're like me and have been less than thrilled with the recycled superhero, boring, propaganda-infused migraines that have been in the theaters for the last few years, then here's your sign to go: John Wick Chapter 4. Being an ardent fan since the release of the first one, I've been cautious going into each subsequent film, waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise. This movie did the exact opposite. Waaaaay over the top action, infused with a lot more humor and tongue-in-cheek sequences, this movie delivers. So much so, I was disappointed to hear there may not be a fifth chapter (as was originally planned), not to mention saddened by the passing of Lance Reddick. The John Wick universe stays fresh and fun four movies in and does not disappoint. Hopefully this isn't the end (insert John Wick's subdued response, "Yeah")!</div>

The action set pieces are absolutely incredible and some choreography must've taken days if not weeks to get everyone prepared for the scenes. The inclusion of the new characters brings freshness to the movie and the don't feel out of place.<br><br>John is carrying on his journey for freedom while taking on the Marquis DeGramont &amp; his henchmen to arrive at a destination by sunrise and the journey there is just non stop action.<br><br>The pacing of the movie runs perfectly and you never get tired or bored<br><br>The ending of the movie is and will be decisive to people and for me I'm happy with the ending...don't know what to think about the end credit scene though !<br><br>If you loved the first 3 in this franchise then I believe you'll thoroughly enjoy this chapter from Mr Reeves and Mr Stahlelski.</div>

Best to describe it: I'm thankful being able to see the best action movie in the 21 century.<br><br>I enjoyed every dialogue, every scene, every perspective and - of course - every headshot. The whole movie is well thought out. Every second has the right to exist. In my 24 years of human being I was never hyped like this. My expectation was 10/10. The movie just had to disappoint me. But it didn't. It surpassed my expectations.<br><br>I talked to a friend and we both said that we could talk one hour about every scene. The desert-horse scene. The Tokyo-continental scene. The German-Club scene. The Paris-car scene. The shotgun-onetake scene. The Paris-stair scene. The dog scenes. The duel scene. And of course those little partly funny partly crazy scenes (for instance the dog pissing on somebody's face after demolishing him or the arrow in the knee upside down scene).<br><br>Every character is perfectly selected. And of course the story line and those details about the John Wick universe is well picked.<br><br>This is a masterpiece of art. Thanks Mr Reeves.</div>

I feel like the Osaka scene should've been closer to the end of the movie, it was incredible.<br><br>Keanu is more tired looking, nowhere near as sharp as JW1, but still incredible, his only competition is himself.<br><br>JW1 was kind of believable, the action was intense, but I could see a top level assassin pulling it off (mostly), with a handful of luck. This John Wick can only be Neo, because this movie defies any possible logic or reason.<br><br>Definitely see in theatres, was a great experience, but no sequel has been as good as the original John Wick movie!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Be prepared because your body will not be prepared for the onslaught on your senses. John Wick Chapter 4 is cinematic action perfection. The movie entertains you every minute and gives you every "bang" for your hard earned bucks. The best John Wick, and I don't say that lightly. Keanu Reeves barely has any lines but commands the screen with his physicality. The rest of the cast is iconic, Donnie Yen and Bill Skarsgard being major stand outs.<br><br>There are multiple actions scenes, some I have never seen in a movie before. Camera Angles, Tension, Lighting Technically made at such a high level your jaw will be on the floor at moments and you won't even realize it. At least in my case I found myself picking mine from floor multiple times.<br><br>Big shout out to Chad Stalhelski too, very rarely does a 4th movie surpass its predecessors but he's found a way. He never lets the audience off the hook, maintaining a razor sharp focus in all of the scenes. Just inspiring work and I can't wait to see what he cooks up next.<br><br>If you haven't figured already, I highly recommend this movie. Go out now and watch it on the biggest screen possible, with a bucket of popcorn, you will not be disappointed.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.<br><br>A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?<br><br>The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.<br><br>I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Absolutely not the best of them. Maybe the worst. Painfully unrealistic, everyone wears literally bulletproof smokings and the elite guys were recruited out of gardeners, tax attorneys and university professors judging by their skill to kill with weapons. When in the first movie John shot each enemy a bullet in the head he now often feels the need to use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).<br><br>As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with this leaves all excitement.<br><br>And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the 4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's forgotten just 3 seconds later.<br><br>None of the characters have personality. Keanus text was probably printed on half a page and mostly consists of 2 syllabus-responses or the name of the person he's just looking at.<br><br>I really like and appreciate Keanu as a person and actor. I just wish the director would have taken this movie serious. I wouldn't want to rewatch even 10 minutes of this letdown of a movie. And it makes me strongly think that most of those 9 or 10-star ratings are bought while I am writing this comment on the first opening weekend.</div>

Keanu Reeves blew it out of the park with his scintillating performance
Chad Stahelski mesmerizes us with his insane action and cinematography
John Wick 4 reminded me why i love cinema the magical feeling you get when you eat something special
This movie is that feeling and more
The world building the characters and the underlying tragedy of one of the greatest characters ever created John Wick
Easily the best film in the franchise and what a film it was keeping us on the edge of our seats in the action scenes awing us with its character interactions and last but not least to see this beautiful journey come to an end put tears in my eyes
Keanu Reeves was perfect as John Wick a match made in heaven he should win an Oscar for this performance some of my favourite things from the movie were him just walking his Sigma walk in an extreme wide shot in full black suit paralleled by pure white snowy backdrop just perfect.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">We get much of the same intense action in this installment of the John Wick franchise as we did from the first 3 movies. Near 3 hours of nonstop stunts and gunplay that will have you groaning in pain with the characters, laughing at some and on the edge of your seat at other times. However, one of the noticeable issues this time around is bad cgi at several points of the movie. This is especially noticeable in car chase scenes or when the assassins on John's trail are being hit by vehicles.<br><br>The music was as fast paced as the action, no complaints there.<br><br>However, can we all just agree that a fight in a club with multiple people dying isn't going to have people continue to dance around you?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I didn't see any other John Wick films before seeing this one and had no expectations beyond a gun fight movie starring Reeves.<br><br>What transpired was an unnecessarily long movie with a script that felt stretched as far as it could go. The first half of the film felt like a serious of contrived action scenes. The Japanese segment droned on for at least twenty minutes just for Wick's old friend to be unnecessarily killed for dramatic effect.<br><br>Then when the viewer is about to abandon all hope of any central storyline, it's revealed Wick can win his freedom by challenging Illuminati guy to a duel. Fair enough. What followed was another 30 minutes of fight scenes just for our guy to technically qualify for the duel.<br><br>In the end Wick wins his freedom but he's shot up and presumably dies thereby invalidating the characters whole motivation during the whole film. If death was an accepting ending for him why didn't he just kill himself?<br><br>Keanu Reeves looks old, tired, and depressed throughout much of this film. He talks slow and at times I wonder if he has early dementia. He's definitely not in his prime anymore and it shows. I'm of the opinion that action stars out of their prime should hang up the gloves and avoid intense action roles. They embarass themselves by providing a less impactful performance than what they were previously capable of.<br><br>My favorite thing about this movie was the avoidance of shaky-cam. All the action scenes use steady-cam shots which allow the viewer to fully take in and understand the scene. While I didn't like the movie much, I am grateful to have supported (with my money) the continued use of steady-camera.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">To start off with, very poor writing/story and the whole movie is stretched for no reason.<br><br>In anticipation for this film I had a movie marathon covering the first 3, and I gotta say its been tiring watching the same leg tackle over a million times done in all the films so far.. There are some absolutely ridiculous sequences of shootouts in public places just like the first 3 movies where people are completely oblivious to wtf is happening around them and that just ruins the immersion.<br><br>In all fairness, there are a couple of scenes that are definitely fresh. But that's about it.<br><br>The whole act with John wick in Tokyo was pure BS, and get this - If you edit out that whole situation in Tokyo the story doesn't change even one bit. Literally has ZERO weight for why it has to be in the film. The stunts in that sequence were definitely off and you can see Keanu struggle in those parts.<br><br>The movie does pick up after 01hr:40min mark and is really enjoyable as it gets to the end. Overall a decent film if you got nothing to watch.</div>

Now everyone's dressed in really fancy clothes, speaking in improbably bad accents and in making strange pseudo mystical comments. Do they hire cheap actors to make the budget work?<br><br>It's started to take it self way too seriously. You've seen all the choreographed moves before and the blind guy is just not believable. The amazing sets and cinematography with all the 'buke' backgrounds have all been done in the three previous films.<br><br>There is one long fight scene shot from an unusual angle which is the highlight of the film and really stands out, it's about 2/3 of the way through the film - I thought it was the finale, but no there was a lot more to come, but with that they'd peaked too soon. I spent a lot of the dialogue scenes looking at the the theatre roof - you think I was going to miss a key plot point by ignoring the hokey nonsense?<br><br>God knows what the 10 star ratings are about.<br><br>I'd give JW1 a 9, JW2 and 8, JW3 7.5.</div>

It follows on from the events of chapter 3 and from the word go - it was leading up to something extraordinary and as the movie developed over time it was breathtaking and funny in parts which kept the audience entertained !<br><br>The action sequences were remarkable and the introduction of Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanoda was very clever and Scott Adkins character was well done and played Killa's part super well and looked totally unrecognisable !<br><br>The Paris scenes were unbelievable and that car chase and fighting scenes around the Arc de Trioumphe was stunningly thrilling and the choice of music really resonated well during that scene.<br><br>Overall - It felt like a proper action movie made for the fans and delivered beyond expectations yet again ! I never felt so happy to come out of the cinema since Top-Gun Maverick ! I hope the rest of Hollywood are watching this and witnessing how an action movie should really be made ! Well done Chad ! You have outdone yourself yet again !</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I was a big fan of the first John Wick film when it first came out - it was so revolutionary in its cinematography, style and choreography of its fight scenes. The second John Wick I found escalated everything that was brilliant about the first one and simply made it all better - better longer fight scenes, better character development and better direction. Then came number three which I was really quite disappointed with. I found the pacing so uncomfortable - there was so much action, so much nonsense on screen that I felt the franchise had lost its way.<br><br>But today I saw chapter 4 - the best way I can describe it it is that it is a strange mix between chapter 2 and chapter 3 but my god does it work. The action, direction and choreography and stunt work on display here has simply never been seen like this in an action movie before. I think I can confidently say that it is the best of the sequels.<br><br>Bill sarsgaard is simply magnificent as the new villain, most of the new characters introduced add depth to the world and it seems to me that the series has come full circle to finally find a place where it belongs - larger than life action with sometimes even sincere character moments and a solidly paced story.<br><br>There are so many fantastic actions sequences here that it is hard to describe how enthralling and how fun they are but rest assured if you are even the slightest fan of action films you will absolutely love John Wick chapter 4.<br><br>By the way... Maybe after this you might want to check out Hotline Miami... Just saying 😉</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Very good addition to the series. Expanding into the realm of martial arts was a welcomed experience. The story picks up right where Jhn Wick 3 left off. Both old and new characters make help the storyline. John Wick Chapter 4 carries the same level of intensity and action as the previous movies. Though the movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes, John Wick Chapter 4 holds you in your seat from start to end (as usual). Recommendation, use the facilities first and hold it until the movie is over. I left two stars off because I fell John Wick 1 &amp; 2 hold the remaining two stars. John Wick fans will be pleased. Very enjoyable movie.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Clocking in at a bladder-busting three hours, this fourth Johnny Wick movie from Lionsgate stubbornly sticks to the franchise's formula. The vague plot sees John Wick still on the run from the High Table, who have not only raised his bounty to $20 million, but also deconsecrates and destroys any Continental Hotel linked to John's movements. Cue a number of repetative action setpieces (all happening at night) that are separated by static dialogue scenes in which characters spout non-stop aphorisms, the first one being no less than Ned Kelly's "Such is life."<br><br>Delayed two years by the novel coronavirus pandemic, JOHN WICK 4 has Hong Kong martial arts cinema legend Donnie Yen co-starring as Zatoichi-style blind swordsman Caine, an old friend of Wick's. The supporting cast is filled out by Bill Skarsgård, Ian McShane, Clancy Brown, Laurence Fishburne, and Shamier Anderson among others. Major disappointments are Keanu Reeve's worst ever line readings, and the wimpy melee fight scenes: punch, kick, chop, stab, pointblank CGI headshot, repeat. But such fare saw JOHN WICK 3 earn $328 million from a budget of $75 million, so loyal fans should enjoy it. I reckon it's good for one viewing because of the ending. There's also a scene in the credits. 6/10 Weet-Bix.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I just saw this movie on Imax and have to says that Is really a good movie. A terrific one. Growing from a simple premise but successful in so many aspects. The elegance of the world where this run is taken to a whole new level without losing the charm they put there from previous installments. The action is just priceless , P R I C E L E S S, with sequences that really shine for the originality and the precision of the cuts, many of them quite long. I want to emphasize the original part, as there are some sequences so clever and original that for sure in the future we will be flooded of this fantastic sequences as everybody will try to copy from now on. The star looks more vulnerable but at the same time more invincible than ever and what you expect from his kills is nothing but the best of the franchise. Terrific additions of new characters are welcomed and some of them really steal the show. Do you remember the dogs? Well, they were not forgotten on this one and for sure the bar was raised again. A lot of scenes looks like taken from a graphical novel, so well performed and choreographed that a bow goes to the director. The locations are stunning and is good to see that finally we have another Cameron to do night scenes. All of them so well illuminated. Fantastic. Actions sequences everywhere and all of them exciting and fast paced. The villains are really good and surprising, making this well entertained. Sound is terrific and colors are superb. This must to be seen in big screen. Almost three hours that run like feather in the air. A solid 9/10 for me, i give a 10 to compensate some 2-3 stars that clearly are trolling the rate without a proper reason. If you looking for action, look no further. This is the one, at least until Mission Impossible arrives, and that movie will need to be quite good if want to take from Mr. Wick the title of Action Movie of the year.</div>

Yeah, it had French subtitles and was interrupted a few times with ads for a lottery in India. But I was able to speed up the dull parts, slow down and replay the action scenes. The only thing I couldn't see was a special scene after the credits, as this version ended just before the credits began.<br><br>If you saw the previous three chapters, you can appreciate that they upped the choreographic level of the fight scenes; the death total easily pushes into the hundreds. Some of it seems gratuitous (OK, it's almost all gratuitous) but it sets a cinematic bar for this kind of lethal action that will likely never be matched.<br><br>Some of the locations (Osaka, Berlin, Paris) seem to have been picked solely for their aesthetics, as in the previous film that took the action out of New York. How this guy gets to instantly zip around the world without being noticed (except by one or two trackers who seem to get to where he winds up even before he does) is almost as mystifying as how he manages to fall multiple times from several stories up, or get hit by cars multiple times, or tumble down dozens of Parisian steps leading to Sacre Couer de Montmartre Church more than once (why did I suddenly think of Laurel &amp; Hardy's classic "The Music Box" -- the one with the piano repeatedly going up and down the long stairs -- while watching this?) and nobody seems smart enough to fire at him from a safe distance while behind a safe barrier. Simple rule... if you get within ten feet of Wick, you are dead. Hey, remember that he can kill with a pencil? Here he attacks a guy with a playing card! Oh, and he gets to use nunchucks for the first time. Lots of bodies breaking through glass, but going through it never seems to cause any cuts.<br><br>It is still implausible that so many supposed professional hit men are so easily dispatched and seem unable to get even one good head shot in out of the hundreds of tries.<br><br>I won't give away the assumed ending, which is both logical and anti-climactic, yet since I didn't see the post-credits scene, I have to wonder if it's a ruse to allow for more of the franchise, seeing as how each film makes more money than the one before it. With this film, the longest of the four, being nearly three hours long, I can only imagine that any fifth film will require bladders of titanium and include a body count in the thousands.<br><br>Reeves has even fewer lines here than in any of the previous shorter films, mostly just saying "Yeah" a lot. He and most of the others talk in epigrams and fortune-cookie-style one-liners meant to sound deep, but usually just come across as goofy or puzzling.<br><br>The tracker known as Mr. Nobody has a dog trained to attack on command, similar (almost identical) to Halle Berry's dogs in Chapter 3. When he says "Nuts" the dog goes for, well, you can guess where. At least five times. When Wick prevents the dog from getting shot (we know how important dogs are to the franchise) Mr. Nobody rethinks his entire raison. Seems his dog's life was worth more than 40 million dollars. But then, killing a pup is the original sin that started this entire franchise!<br><br>Some parts are better than the whole. Some parts make little or no sense. Not a single cop is ever seen no matter how much violence ensues; indeed, in several places, while guns are blazing and swords are swinging, the civilians just act as if nothing is happening, and make no attempt to flee. So much is a cross between cartoonish -- several Wiley-Coyote-style falls, minus the anvil, but still no apparent injuries -- and video game choreography (there's even a god's-eye-view tracking shot that clearly was lifted from an actual video game).<br><br>I'm told that the classic 1979 New York action film "The Warriors" was the template for this film, with Wick substituting for an entire NYC gang trying to make it home. In an outright theft, they even have a black female DJ's closeup mouth to the mic smugly following Wick's trip across the city, exactly as in the earlier film (Lynne Thigpen did it better; oh, those lips!).<br><br>If you've seen the previous three films, and appreciate what was done superlatively, and overlooked the implausibles and recycled tropes, I guess you will have to see Chapter 4 for whatever supposed closure it may or may not offer. When someone catches the post-credits scene, please let me know what was in it, as I'm pretty sure it's the key to how Chapter 5 begins.<br><br>Yeah... a franchise film that debuts at $72 million (almost double the last bounty on Wick's life), the best start of the whole series, isn't going to toss away the opportunity to rake in even more. After all, the High Table hasn't been defeated, the New York Continental has to be rebuilt, and Laurence Fishburne needs more scenery to chew up. Expect gratuitous trips to London, Rome, and Istanbul.</div>

The runtime is just padded with action that isn't that great. It's like a damn video game. Come on. The first John Wick is the best purely because the action feels real.<br><br>The plot is also sorta weak. Few characters are not required at all for the plot to happen. Why did they need the whole blind angle? Why go the Daredevil path? WHY?! The tracker character was not required too. His presence didn't change the plot in any way at all.<br><br>The fight scene, with the drone, before the end is basically a video game scene. Gotta be kidding me. As the ending scene developed, it was kinda predictable too. You mean tell me a god damn blind assassin is better than everyone else ? They are openly mocking us for giving them money for making dumb plots.<br><br>I wouldn't have felt bad if I had skipped it. I am a huge John Wick fan. The first movie with the "focus, commitment, sheer will" inspired me. This one doesn't even have that line !<br><br>Utterly disappointed.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time to call it a day.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.<br><br>The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsgård), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.<br><br>John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and protégé.<br><br>The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 &amp; 2.<br><br>The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.<br><br>Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick 1-3 made everyone always ask how the next one could top this one. Not only have the films created longer, more unique, and brutal action scenes, but they have increasingly developed the John Wick world. The audience showing their love for the unrealistic has propelled the franchise to lean more towards the absurdity, and deepening the John Wick world into that where normality in John Wick 4 is impossible in the real world.<br><br>Approaching the 4th chapter, you have to accept the rules in the John Wick world, not as faults in the screenplay, but as a necessary characteristic of storytelling that supports the extensive action scenes that we come to expect. John Wick 4's success is measured in how it succeeds with what it wants to fulfill for the audience, which is a stunning visual/auditory experience mixed with extended fun action scenes. The story between action is more about using characters and their methodology to expand your knowledge of this world. Sure, John has a goal, but it's purposely 3rd nature as it more or less is shaped by others around him.<br><br>None of the movies have cared much about a deep story. John Wick 4 carries this tradition as well as seeing if it can succeed by moving the goal posts to see how far they can take the action. The lengthy run time flies by, thereby exemplifies how well the film succeeds with the action. It answers the question how could the other movies be topped. Now, how can John Wick 4 be topped?</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...<br><br>What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see "John Wick" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The "John Wick" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no "real world" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.<br><br>Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.<br><br>Also, the "Gun-Fu" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. "John Wick: Chapter 4" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.<br><br>Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.<br><br>Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is "the best action film of all time," maybe you should rent "The Raid: Redemption" or "The Raid 2." Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent "Atomic Blonde." As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to "the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action." "Atomic Blonde" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...<br><br>Anyway, "John Wick: Chapter 4" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+</div>

Nothing comes close.<br><br>It's nice to watch an action movie where you can see every gunshot and the consequence of them. No shakiness with the camera, you see everything from all different kind of angles. Also shows you don't need big explosions or massive set pieces to really have a great action movie.<br><br>John wick chapter 4 does have big set pieces but the action involved is so close range it doesn't feel like they are big set pieces. I especially feel the cinematography really compliments this and is key to making the action top notch.<br><br>My only concern was with the massive run time of almost 3 hours but it definitely didn't feel like it. It didn't drag like other long films over the past year (wakanda forever and the batman as examples)<br><br>I also watched this in Imax and I'm so glad I did. It was definitely made for an Imax screen.<br><br>You need to go watch it in the cinema, I can't recommend it enough!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This was definitely a wild ride. Saw a review saying John Wick getting shot at so much without getting shot was unrealistic. I mean the whole concept is unrealistic which is why he is the Baba Yaga. Also the bulletproof lining in the suits help.<br><br>What was unrealistic was the fat guy being able to land a few kicks on John Wick. Now if he was more of a traditional boxer than a kicker, than would make more sense.<br><br>Donnie Yen really ruled in this. My favorite thing he did in the film was (being blind) he use a barrel of the gun find a man's face so he could hit him. It was pretty sweet what they did with his character.<br><br>I wish the daughter at the beginning had more of a presence, but in terms of female fighters, preferred her MUCH better than Halle Berry's character in chapter 3.<br><br>Best part for my enjoyment was the fight in the old building. They did a single shot that panned out and gave a bird's eye view of the fight scene and it was awesome.<br><br>Sadly, it looks like they may have actually buried John Wick in this one. However, I suspect Baba Yaga is not actually gone. When they were at his grave, John's dog turned and looked off in the distance so I'm wondering if he saw John.<br><br>One sad part was the concierge being killed given the real life actor had passed away in real life.<br><br>So not a 10/10 because of the fat guy being able to land size-able kicks, but all in all EPIC.</div>

The scene with the shotgun was 10/10. That long shot was probably my favorite Wick scene to date. The ending of the movie was perfect. I couldn't think of a more fitting end to the story. John Wick has planted itself as one of the greatest action franchises of all time. Each movie is better than the last, and the story never manages to lose control. I always expect the movies to fall off at some point, but they simply don't. These movies are fun, violent, and actually tell a great story.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I am a big big John Wick fan. When i first saw it i was in love with the character and the idea and the freshness it brought to the table of action genre.<br><br>We spend few last days before movie arrived in high expectations and when we saw 9/10 rating on imdb we were like this will be HUGE! Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.<br><br>First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.<br><br>This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.<br><br>Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.<br><br>I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!<br><br>Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!<br><br>Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott "unrecognizable" Adkins.<br><br>Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe. Disgusting what they did with movie and character!<br><br>To all John Wick fans who waited this so long and were si excited to see it.. you don't need to. Definitely not paying for it in cinemas! Stick to the first three movies and make some happy ending in your head. This is EPIC FAIL.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Contains spoilers.<br><br>I watched all 4 parts one by one in cinema. And starting from 1 to 4 it was getting worse. This part 4 looks like a joke parody on original.<br><br>Here we have a blind killer! Who is even more dangerous than Wick himself. This is ridiculous.<br><br>All those bulletproof suits. In the second part John got so much pain when someone shot him at least once into his armor. Now he does'nt feel like this is laser tag or something (not even paintbal).<br><br>John falls from 4 floor on a car and casually stands up and keeps running. He got smashed by car on full speed like 5 times, no problem. Cars in the center of the city hit people multiple times, no one even stops. They kill each other in the club noone cares. Even in computer games you have more realism than here.<br><br>Katana and sword fights when everyone have a gun. I know this is popular trick when Japan is concerned, but it looks quite not wise in this kind of movies.<br><br>Falling from the stairs reminded me of jokes about injured Neymar that is rolling infinitely. What a joke.<br><br>And last duel. Really? Duel with blind man.... Why? Why?? 3 hours, it got boring already, and now we get duel.<br><br>The first 3 parts were so good, comparing to this. I don't get why people put 10 stars to this. I just don't know.<br><br>This is my first review, but I just can't avoid writing how overhyped this movie is.<br><br>5 and only from respect to Mr Keanu.</div>

Just because the movie is filled with action scene doesn't make it a great movie. Honestly it's wayyyyyy too long, the rythm is bad, the John Wick character and arc are uninteresting as hell, other characters are under-developped, too many CGI, and OMG the ending just sucks a** There are some good fight scene in the movie, that can't be denied, but there are also way too many non-sense as well (e.g. The scene in the Berlin club where people keep dancing lik nothing is happening while bullets fly and axes are being burried in heads right and there, come on...). Don't know if this review will be helpful, be just be aware of the false hype. JW4 is not a good movie, sorry.</div>

The move is action from beginning to the end. 2.45 running time goes very fast. The plot is well known, and it is done better this time. This is not a movie, it is art. This movie will stand as the best movie as CR has played in. If you love 1-2-3, this give you the finesse and thrill, all the other movies combined. We sat struck in the theater. The filming is ground braking. The sound is taking you inside of JW world. I hope to see this movie One time more in theater. A lot of details would be missed due to the focus you get in the scenes. This is must see for 2023. If you have not seen any of the other 3 movies. Go and see this. And you get a new friend. John Wick - all should have One friend like him.</div>

This movie is just following the synopsis of James bond and its movie series. John wick's story is supposed to be about revenge, not playing gaming cards and deciding the winner. The action was too less and the fight choreography was extremely too poor in this part. At least the previous part has some good action sequences even though it doesn't have a story. A nice touch of a gentleman's conversation and nice cinematography. I wish they could have shown us the story of Baba Yaga instead of this cheap story running around a high table for no reason. Wasted part. Could have been a lot better.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Now this is an whole lot better than "John Wick - Paracetamol" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful "Marquis" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the "High Table" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting "Winston" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the "Marquis" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for "Wick", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor "James Bond" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting "thwack" and "pow" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick: Chapter 4 sucked. Here's why.<br><br>1. The characters. Caine is not interesting. There's no way a hitman could be blind and competent at their job. Even for John Wick, a series where the main character can survive multiple gunshots, it's unrealistic. Caine did not have to be blind either. His character could have been a normal hitman and it would've been way more compelling. Plus, he's pretty flat as a person and doesn't have any personality traits. Killa was equally bad. His gimmick of being comically french fell extremely flat and he's pretty annoying. Mr Nobody served no purpose to the story as well.<br><br>2. The writing. There were plot holes upon plot holes. Even for a John Wick movie it was unbelievable 'Nough said.<br><br>3. The action was much worse than the other films in the series. John Wick is usually regarded as having realistic action in that the attacks and gun play the characters would do would be based in reality. This was not the case. Enemies take turns attacking John Wick and the hand to hand fight scenes were much less grounded in actual fighting techniques.<br><br>4. The movie was too long. That's it.<br><br>5. The beginning was pretty bad, much worse than the rest of the movie.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Just watched John Wick 4, OMG, the best action film of this year and by far has the be the best John Wick film in the series. The fight scenes were amazing, it was long but the film felt fast. This film is way better than John Wick 3 and big time better than John Wick 2.<br><br>Once again, good acting by Keanu Reeves as always he brings the character John Wick alive. It was good to see Hiroyuki Sanada in this film, I wished he had a bigger role but ill take his acting any-day. Donnie Yen was amazing in this film, I just wanted to see a big showdown one more time been his character Caine and John Wick but very good action from the both of them.<br><br>I love the new camera angle which you will see near the end of the film between the fight scenes.<br><br>We get more interactions between other characters and more people talking.<br><br>The Fight scenes just keep getting better and better. John Wick once again pushed to his limits and takes such much beating in this film. Please go and watch this film in the cinema for the story, action, jumper moments, the thrilling moments of the chase and mostly fight scenes.<br><br>The film ended in a very good way and personal, I think they should leave it with John Wick 4 only. How can you top this film. Dont push the series like fast has down. Go out with a bang. 10/10 &amp; 5/5 rating for me.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Just watched the 4th installment of John Wick and what a ride. This movie can be considered the best of John Wick Franchise and rightfully so. Non-Stop action, funny lines, and awesome fight sequences. If you are a fan of John Wick universe you will definitely enjoy this one. Although it is the longest among John Wick movies but i enjoyed every moment of it. It is rare to see in movies that sequels do very good and some time better than the previous installments, but John Wick 4 nailed it. This movie is one of the best action movies i've seen in the recent years and i will definitely watch it again. 10 out of 10.</div>

It was especially good to drift with the car and shoot the enemies and adjust the camera angle from above. I've never been to a movie a second time, but I can go to this movie a second time.this is what real action movie looks like. I wish laurence fishburne had been in the movie more it would have been better.this movie is just perfect. Like I said, the musics was excellent. Such beautiful musics suits such a beautiful movie.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I gave this film 10/10 and it earned every single star. Shot in NYC, Jordan, Japan, and Paris, the film captured the beauty and timelessness of each nations' historical locations. The cinematography is the best I have seen in years. The plot emerges and presents an out for John that will release him from his life on the run. Two hours and forty five minutes later, an ending that brought tears to my eyes, including the post credits scene. There is NO WAY our guy is dead, God help me, there better be another John Wick film or we will riot.<br><br>The only downside of the film is Reeves' acting. They are smart to give him a small amount of dialogue, anything beyond those few words is comical. But I, as I'm sure many others, forgive him. John is a man of few words, therefore Keanu was perfect for the role. He has always been the rare A lister that acts his heart out with minimal dialogue, and somehow pulls it off. Let that be a lesson to you kids, if you have charisma but sound like a teenage stoner, you too can succeed.</div>

Also in some scenes john wicks facial expressions were lacking. He worked hard to make this character as rugged as he possibly can; (with his stunts and fighting style) but some fightings scenes are soo long that it really bored some viewers. Story is good and its a 2.40 hrs long movie and i think it worth it but some unrealistic scene are made people yawn. Donny yein played his character very well but this is not possible that a blind man can fight in such a effective way, that was little too much. Although he already revealed that in a interview but somewhere it felt like his character was not properly utilised. Overall its an average movie, i mostly like the cinematography, editing, costume, action and every other small thing and its worth one time watching in a big screen.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">It is probably the best John Wick movie ever. Everything is almost on point. The director knows what people want to watch. The martial arts are so good to watch and are beautifully choreographed. All the casts played along with Wick. They did add the meaning to the movie. Less talk, more action. Something that I like from an action movie.<br><br>Been waiting this movie for a while. Can't wait to see the prequels. A must movie in March. You will not regret every minute you spend to watch this movie.<br><br>Freedom is something everyone may want to have in this life regardless of the efforts to achieve it. 😃</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Like many John Wick fans I considered the original film to be an amazing sleeper hit with an original premise that reignited Keanu Reeves' star power, and John Wick: Chapter 2 was a bombastic sequel that took us deeper into the world of Wick's former livelihood.<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 3 made me grow numb and impatient sitting in my chair. It was like watching someone play a Beat Em' Up (or Shoot Em' Up) game where they go through waves of enemies until they get to the level boss. Streets of Rage and Time Crisis come to mind. Anyone who is a gamer and a film buff knows what I'm talking about. In John Wick: Chapter 4 it felt like more of the same.<br><br>A recurring theme since the third film is that John Wick is given literal plot armor in the form of a Kevlar suit, but also the waves of bullet sponge henchmen he can effectively dispatch with a headshot. JUST. LIKE. A. VIDEOGAME. He can also survive getting thrown off a roof AND fall down five flights of steps. Might as well give Wick a life bar floating over his head.<br><br>Then there are the dogs with a pencant for biting men's testes and the stock cartoon European Villain of the Week who uses underhanded methods to kill Wick. Russian, Italian, German, French, whatever. They're all interchangeable.<br><br>Ditto for the largely Asian "top assassins" that will pop up to give Keanu Reeves the best choreographed fight scene. And let's not forget the EDM clubs and metro city subways where civilians are largely oblivious to what's going on.<br><br>All of this stuff is trite and cliche, and I guess this is what people like because it's a break from the superhero fare that has saturated the action movie genre for the past 15 to 25 years.<br><br>Maybe it's because I grew up in a decade (1990's) where there were still good high-profile films being produced in a sea of higher-profile schlock that my film tastes are hungry for something engaging and thought-provoking, and John Wick 4 ain't it no matter how much people try to pretend that the world these characters live in is compelling.</div>

Just when you think you've seen everything there is to do with action, John Wick: Chapter 4 comes along and flips the entire genre on its head. This is an emotional, propulsive classic that more than justifies its epic runtime.<br><br>The set pieces are bigger and better than you've ever seen. It's incredible how much innovative action Stahelski can still conjure up. This series continues its rich tradition of exceptional lore and world building. Combined with some truly beautiful imagery and balletic fight scenes, this fourth film is a joy to behold. No action film utilizes color and atmosphere quite like John Wick, as scene after scene looks like it could be a painting in the Louvre. This legendary film franchise reaches its grand conclusion in epic fashion. It's genuinely sad to see this iconic series come to an end. Or does it?</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This is the level of action sequences and choreography designs that Marvel should be showcasing - all hail 87eleven! Barebow, katana, cane-sword, nunchaku, sniper rifle, metallic poker, blaster, dueling pistol, all manipulated in the most enthralling and incredible way, not as disposable tools, but as dopamine-full syringes that inject thrilling signals right down the thalamus. In particular, two combat scenes electrified me (no spoilers don't worry), the first being Caine's "warmup": his leisurely demeanor, ingenious gadgets, and breakneck motion swiftly establish a dangerous figure that actually might neutralize John Wick in his own movie. Bringing back memory of the blind monk from Rogue One, Donnie Yen's performance of Caine is exquisite, whether his gait, head movement, or battle style. The second scene that blew me away was John's slaughter in the suite, where a long shot follows the killing machine from above the ceiling through multiple rooms as he effortlessly obliterates his enemies with a freaking dragon's breath shotgun. Despite the ubiquitous usage of long takes to display flawless action designs, this scene tops it all off with inventive cinematography, and I love every bit of the RPG vibe it gives.<br><br>However, like Black Adam, constant fighting comes at a price, which in this case is shown through the characters, the story, and the plot progression. Mr. Nobody is a slightly redundant character, especially when compared to Caine, with an inconsistent motive and a forgettable presence. In my opinion, the part of this character could be entirely deleted to enrich Caine's connection with his daughter and with John, which would result in a more engaging final showdown - but, having Donnie Yen in this film is a blessing, so not a big complaint. However, the abundance of action sequences does perceptively make the plot simpler, as many of the events are deliberately arranged just to transition into another brawl. In the end, there is a point where the fighting fatigues, and I'm referring to the staircase scene: seeing John neymar his way down those steps he took such a long time to climb disrupts the momentum completely. Lastly, perhaps Keanu is a revered celebrity, but he is probably the worst actor in this movie: robotic line delivery, immutable facial expression, and the hairstyle that confuses John Wick with Neo from Matrix Resurrection.<br><br>Overall, one of the best action films of the decade, but an average movie in all other aspects.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">If you're looking for a thrilling action movie, John Wick 4 is definitely the movie series to watch! Everything in this world revolves around rules, and it's been a while since I've seen a movie that captures this concept so well. The direction and use of lighting in the movie is simply phenomenal, and it takes the movie to another level.<br><br>There are moments when it seems like the action is over the top, but the movie quickly redeems itself with the next scene. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves action movies, as it is an incredible experience from start to finish.<br><br>The Continental grounds, the 9mm carbon pistol, crest, rules, and the setting in Japan with the sumo fighters were all executed flawlessly. The costumes, logos, music, dogs, cars, bikes, and horses added another layer of excitement to the movie.<br><br>I particularly enjoyed the dragon fire breath gun, which was just plain fun to watch. Overall, this movie series is a thrilling and exciting ride, and I'm looking forward to Lions Gate releasing more seasons and episodes in the future. The artistic direction of the movie series is definitely worth a praise, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good action flick.</div>

While the JW4 trailer do showcase the level of action you're about to see, but some of the best action scenes are not in the trailer, so you have a lot to discover as you go on a ride with John Wick on his quest to challenge the High Table.<br><br>While most people are talking about the insane level of action, let me tell you the two other factors that made this movie a cinematic treat to watch.<br><br>Lighting - Most of the movie scenes are shot at night and they are done beautifully. The neon lights contrast with the dark sky and ultra-black suits and guns and pistols and armours. It creates a new dimension of its own.<br><br>Camera Work - The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is so immersive. Just after the Paris car scene is over and when John enters a building, pay attention to how the camera moves from the moment John is on the stairs. That scene alone with a spectacular one long-shot camera work is gonna blow you apart.<br><br>Watch John Wick 4 in IMAX for the best experience.</div>

I felt like I was in a Star Wars sequel with people either running or being shot at for almost 3 hours. Cinematography was fabulous and it did take you to other countries in a realistic and enjoyable way, however, so if you could sit back and enjoy that, it was worth it.<br><br>I believe Keanu Reeves' immortality outperformed Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series after being shot about 84 times, thrown down flights of stairs multiple times and off buildings - and no - the Kevlar suit wasn't convincing to me.<br><br>Whereas blind people can do amazing things, Reeves' love-hate relationship with a former friend was not convincing.<br><br>In college, I learned that fiction still works if it is at least somewhat believable in its own setting. This one missed the mark.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">It was well shot and Choreographed. Action was fine... and then it got tiresome... and then it got boring and repetitive.<br><br>Basically, you're just checking your watch to realize there's still an hour of this movie left. While fans eat this up, passive viewers are checking out. There was do much time that could have been edited out, but the director had to make sure every step was on camera. Literally, there are moments where you have nothing of value put on screen for no necessary reason. Do we seriously need to see him walk the entire distance to the candles, light a candle, and walk all the way to his seat? Do we need the extra hour of random assassins just to pretend he'll be stopped?<br><br>You gotta be crazy to call this the best action film. It's okay, but too self indulgent and overlong to watch again. Can directors please stop making movies over 2.5 hrs long?<br><br>Spoilers:<br><br>John wick kills hundreds, gets to a duel, gets mortally wounded, and kills the big bad. He wins everything, and dues on steps. Every action scene is him turning corners. Shooting guys, stabbing those close to him, reloading, and doing it again.<br><br>If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same as the last three movies sans the loss of his dog in the first (the only good one).</div>

Never watched previous installment of John Wick although the character catches your eyes at very instant as appear on the screen, the story couldn't be better if the characters didn't give justice to their part all in all a MUST watch Movie. The German Sphered has stand alone performance along with Keanu Reeves,
Donie Yen, Scott Adkins, Bill Skarsgård, Ian Macshan, Lauren Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada. The initial fight sequence in Japan was best continue shot I have ever seen in action movies. The Ending will bring out yours tears. One thing everyone should accept John Wick is a loving husband and is not dead yet.<br><br>"</div>

I have never walked out a a cinema mid film before, and I love the cinema, so that should be a warning to anyone even considering watching this file - JUST DON'T. " To the extent that Wick's vehicles follow the same schematic as musicals, with shootouts taking the place of song-and-dance numbers, the script doesn't have to do much more than usher the characters from one showstopper to the next." It you must watch this film, wait for it to come to the or streaming, don't waste any of your money on this and I'd say don't wait a second of your time either!</div>

While there is quite a bit of CGI enhancement, it doesn't detract from the live action which feels very fresh and visceral.<br><br>It's a shame that the JW movies are getting longer, since the extra runtime in subsequent movies has not added any depth or more excitement than the first - more is not necessarily better.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">From Director Chad Stahelski comes the 4th installment of the long running franchisee which is not showing any sign of slowing down. It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.<br><br>Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.<br><br>This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style.<br><br>Although I noticed one thing that this part does not offer anything inventive in terms of use of anything in combat sequences but still holds great for the sequences to work. I thought to myself what could they possibly show to top the action sequences shown before in the franchisee but they always find a way to surprise you in the best ways possible.<br><br>Seeing Keanu Reeves doing most of the stunts all by himself and the talent involved in making all this work by Chad Stahelski (who himself has been doing great stunts as a stuntman for the past 2 decades) and it shows in his zeal to achieve the best outcome with lesser reliance on the VFX and more on practical effects and using real life locations instead of using green screen half the time as they (Marvel and DC to name a few) normally do.<br><br>Well I would sum up by saying that this outing is his best yet and it would be wise for you to watch it on the big screen and not wait for it to come on OTT.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The first John Wick movie made something really special. They introduce us a semi-realistic action movie as a genre. Unfortunately they set the bar too high and with every movie things have gotten worse. I am deeply sorry to watch this movie to get Marvelised. A frickin blind dude who just happens to see everything? The staircase scene? Are you kidding me? Yeah yeah we are about to kill each other but first let me save your dog from the bad guys? Lets just make the dog pee over the bad dudes corpse with cheesey one liner? It had some great scenes but at this point this isnt a John Wick movie. It is like a bad parody of it from Marvel.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The John Wick movies have run out of ideas and just rehash the other movies. Keanu is still stiff and half asleep throughout the movie and luckily they give him very little dialogue. The other actors are superb especially Donnie Yen, who is an actual martial artist. He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.<br><br>The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high. It seems like the director enjoys the same backgrounds.....church, falling down lots of steps, dance hall where everyone keeps dancing even though there is gunfire.<br><br>It lacks the humor of the Taken movies and great acting in the Equalizer.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe It was a mistake to bingewatch the three previous movies beforhand. But my two friends and myself are unanimous after watching the movie durong a premiere : it was BAD. I mean, REALLY BAD.<br><br>SPOILERS ALERT.<br><br>Where do I begin. The movie starts with a plan in a dark room with Keanu hitting some board to train himself and Morpheus, euh I mean Laurence Fishburne's Hobo King character telling him it's time. And then... we almost didn't see him for the rest of the movie. It doesn't make any sense since he was the main ally John Wick could count on at the end of the third movie. In fact, nothing makes sense in this movie afterwards !<br><br>Right after, he's teleported in the desert, chasing guys on horse, and he kills the wiseman just like that. Why ? There are so many characters there that doesn't have any purpose in the story, like the mercenary and his dog. Same for the Father and his daughter in Japan. John Wick travels all over the world but we don't even know why.<br><br>The main antagonist... oh my god. Take all the clichés you can find on the french aristocracy and put it in one guy, and you got this movie's villain. Onlike any other villain of the franchise, he's not even scared a little bit of John Wick, not until the very end... when he choses a blind guy to do a pistol dual with John. Yeah right !<br><br>Almost everything that made the previous movies so good is thrown away : the lights and colors, the rythm, the scared villains, the original choregraphies of the fights, etc. Another element that is lacking : John Wick's pain. This time, he doesn't look tough and resilient, with sheer will and tenacity. He just look stupididly invincible and invulnerable. He can get it by a car 5 times, fall from 5 stories, or from 222 stairs... no problem at all ! He's not even slightly injured. It's just ridiculous !<br><br>At some point, people in the theater were laughing and it was clearly not supposed to. My friend fell asleep and I was looking at my watch. Oh and if you know Paris, you realize the traject he follows is absurd.<br><br>I don't know if it's a coincidence but it seems that they changed the scenarists for this last installment. I've also read that the original version before cut had a near 4 hour lenght. Maybe we got here a part of the explanation.... sorry Keanu.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">First of all I want to start by saying that this film, in any shape or form will satisfy you if you're a die hard John Wick fan like me.<br><br>It has caught my attention that the reviews for Chapter 4 has been nothing but high scores and prasing reviews... (Even people saying that its the best chapter!) Sadly I couldn't figure out exactly why.<br><br>The first and the biggest problem in my opinion is that the film includes close to none character development. For me, a John Wick movie must, and I say this again, must make you eager for the thought of John Wick taking his revenge from other villians. However in this movie sadly all you get is unlimited bodies thrown at John and no sense of that anger and fury.<br><br>Another problem is that the film is absurdly unrealistic. Of course we all know that John Wick movies are supposed to be unrealistic to some degree but this one makes you want to leave the theater... The cringe caused physical pain on my body.<br><br>The last thing I want to mention is that the movie didn't feel like a sequal to any chapters. There are so many new characters that you actually get lost. Honestly you could go watch it without seeing any of the chapters and have little to none problem understanding the story. Sadly it felt completely like a different movie in a bad way.<br><br>TLDR: Worst chapter of the sequal. Unrealistic, and boring. No sense of the John we know of. Too much action and not enough story. Of course these are my opinions, go watch it for yourself. Hope you enjoy it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I am a great fan of the first John Wick movie. A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.<br><br>He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!<br><br>In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!<br><br>He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.<br><br>Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).<br><br>Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.<br><br>Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.<br><br>So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat. Also the cinematography and music is really nice.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">There is art in everything and in JW4 it's the ballet of violence. From the get go, the movie unleashes artfully choreographed violence that involves weapons, martial arts and just pure raw hand to hand combat.<br><br>Ideologically, I am against violence but I saw this as art, a form of expression and when I saw it like that, it just felt like I was watching a dance performance. It just happens to be violence in this case. Keanu reeves is excellent, a little older but smooth and has given a 100% to every scene.<br><br>The movie runs quickly without wasting too much time on building narrative, most of it is simple, clear and precise. Is it realistic? NO, but you did come to watch JW4 so just enjoy the ride.</div>

Car chase? Check. Club scene? Check. Martial arts? Check. Swords? Check. Guns? Check. Using random items around you? Check. Fighting on a busy street? Check. Fighting up stairs? Check. Everything you love in a John Wick movie is here, and the 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't even seem long. You leave actually wanting a little bit more. They really leaned into the stylized action and did it properly. Eastern, European, and Western action all blend together perfectly and how John Wick adapts to every situation and weapon just shows how amazing he truly is and why he's the Baba Yaga. Yes there are times where you would think "how are they not dead", but it's the same with some bad guys too. Just get lost in the action and story, because it tugs at the emotions too and shows you John is just a guy who wants peace but everything keeps bringing him back in.<br><br>P. S. How has John Wick never been turned into one of the most amazing games ever?</div>

Everyone has bullet proof suits, but not one of the countless disposable useless henchmen thinks to maybe aim for the head?? I get it's a movie and get John Wick is a man of focus..... But walks away from getting hit by so many cars I lost count, literally falling out of buildings... But then dies from a mere stomach wound....... Loved the first two, was just about ok with the third, but this one was too far for me to stretch I am afraid. Just cant understand all the rave reviews...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I wanted to like this movie so badly. The first three were great, albeit gradually declining in quality throughout the series. I was excited and hopeful for the fourth installment but couldn't have been let down more. The action was boring by mid film and there was still another hour and a half to go at that point. This movie is ten minutes shy of three hours long. The fight scenes go on way longer than they need to, moves are repeated over and over and the plot armor of JW becomes laughable. If you like the film because John is a regular guy with crazy skills, you'll hate this. If you see him as some kind of superhero then you'll probably enjoy it. The guy legit falls out of 5 story buildings onto stone roadways and just rolls over and gets up. It felt insulting to my intelligence.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">A bullet ballet with lots of overly long action scenes full of complex fight choreography. It looks and plays out just like a videogame - the protagonist defeats an overwhelming number of enemies, shrugs off damage like it is nothing and bystanders either don't exist or act oblivious to the ensuing violence. The setting always required a suspension of belief and realism, but this one with its bullet proof suits and vehicle fight scene was ridiculous. The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around. Some sequences were entertaining, the support cast and their fluid alliances was good, the ending was rather fitting and although a long film, it didn't feel it.</div>

Bad guy gets hit by a car-dead
John Wick gets hit by a car-nothing
Bad guy falls off the edge-dead
John Wick falls from a 3 story building onto the roof of a van-nothing.<br><br>3 hours of my life that I won't get back. Don't even bother with the DVD/release on Sky, just avoid it.</div>

At times I felt like I was on a roller-coaster or the adrenaline you get playing basketball. I hope they make more because they're so much fun, but if it is the last that's a helluva way to go.

The action scenes were brilliant, and I won't spoil it but there was one scene that took my breath away with the way it was filmed. Kudos to the director, actors, stuntman and all involved in this movie. It lived up to the franchise and is my second favorite after the original.<br><br>The plot was simple, and the foreshadowing a bit heavy, but all around an awesome action movie and so fun to watch. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next action sequence, the nearly 3 hours passed by much faster than I was expecting. Really great movie and a must see!</div>

However it is nice to see a modicum of effort involved. Our story here will not win any awards, but it's just a series of flimsy excuses to have endless fight scenes play out. Lots of ammunition is expended, lots of people are kicked, thrown around and punched. And if you enjoy seeing people meeting an unfortunate encounter with a vehicle (moving or stationary), you will not be disappointed.<br><br>All the John Wick films have a 1990's era Homg Kong action movie vibe.

Some of them you have already seen like the way John Kills with pistols but the car sequence &amp; The fire Gun killing scenes will 100% blow your mind &amp; the different camera angle makes it more unique! The movie is 3 hours long but Don't worry you are not gonna regret it... donnie yan the master has done amazing job, simply outstanding with his sword!! At some points you gotta feel for John. If you are a true john wick fan you'll understand the pain he's going through the whole movie.... the scene i liked the most in which john's driving car &amp; killing bunch of peoples at the same timing, i bet you'll love it too!!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is hard to write. I'm a huge Keanu fan as well as the Wick character. However, this 4th installment left me wanting and at times checking the clock during the show. You have probably already read that the action and fighting is good. It is, but it's not new or innovative. Assuming you've seen the first 3? There's guns, hand to hand, cool use of the environment, lots of bullet proof clothing and ineffective hits, a dog and some of the other Wick tropes. I guess I was expecting another new style or sweet scenario. I enjoyed the movie, but was expecting a Wick experience and instead got a, 'quest for more money' type of vibe where the scenes and situations seemed repetitive. I suggest seeing the flick, just temper your expectations and hope they don't unequivocally jump the shark on a 5th. Wick is great, but it's not a franchise to simply repeat and this installment feels like the beginning of that.</div>

John Wick: Chapter 4 continuously punches above its weight with bigger and better ... well, everything. The lighting is better, the staging is more impressive, the fight choreography is absolutely insane. The excess here is the point, and it's never been more satisfying. The entire Osaka sequence feels like a marathon; then he's gun-battling in a speeding Barracuda; and there's even a setpiece built around stairs. The man even fights a guy in traffic.<br><br>TRAFFIC!<br><br>I freely admit that I'm that guy in the theater that squealed when the nunchucks came out (and they weren't a one-and-done either, he just kept beating people!)<br><br>This gave me the "Top Gun: Maverick" kind of high; an impeccably-paced three hours of sustained adrenaline. I don't think such enjoyment of bone-crunching violence is normal, but I don't care. This movie was an absolute blast!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">If there's a 5, I'm certain it HAS to be a crossover with the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. Yes, this is getting THAT live-action cartoonish.<br><br>I loved it, but there hasn't been a bad John Wick movie. In fact, after writing this review, I want to compile a best/most consistent Action franchises of all-time list. This series will HAVE to be at/near the top of the greats. Four movies in, four incredible feats.<br><br>Now, like I said above, this is getting pretty far-fetched. YES, John's survived countless ordeals, shots, hits and of course, heads-up battles with cars in the past 3 movies. Unfortunately, with this outing, they had me almost say, "enough" by the time the climax is over.<br><br>That all said, maybe I was too harsh with comparing this to the horribly over-the-top Fast &amp; Furious films which are so fathomly unrealistic, I hated most of the movies in that series. I couldn't possibly even dislike any of the John Wicks. But...it is getting a little too hard to suspend disbelief.<br><br>So, John's in a pickle. When has he not been since his dog and car were taken from him in 2014? John must face many bosses before the climax and you can bet he'll be battling much of the almost-three-hour runtime.<br><br>The more I think about this, the more I like it. It is NOT perfect, and I would certainly rank 1 and 3 higher. Still, you need to see this if you're a fan.<br><br>As mentioned, this is nearly three hours. Mercifully, it does NOT feel that way. Well, for the most part. I examined a few scenes that dragged out longer than they should have and they were some of the non-action scenes, of course. Everything else: you're just along for the glorious ride of watching John Wick fight countless henchmen to reach his goal.<br><br>While it doesn't have the depth of 1 or the Halle Berry of 3, it's a worthy chapter in an otherwise fantastic franchise. It's also pretty good looking and has some incredible side characters with complex motives that I absolutely LOVED. In fact, the more the movie went along, the more I loved how they kept the two main side characters fresh for the three acts.<br><br>I do hope there's a John Wick: Chapter 5, but if it ends here, I'm totally fine. I mean, they kept trying to reboot TV's 24 after it's exciting and conclusive 8 initial seasons and that was a huge mistake.<br><br>John Wick's rep established in the first one holds up here. SEE THIS!!<br><br>***<br><br>Final Thoughts: Here's my ranking:<br><br>1. John Wick (2014) ~ EASY #1<br><br>2. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum<br><br>3. John Wick: Chapter 4 ~ barely beating out the 4th spot<br><br>4. John Wick: Chapter 2.</div>

However, I am delighted to say that my worries were unfounded as John Wick 4 manages to surpass the previous films with its action-packed sequences.<br><br>Despite its lengthy runtime, the movie keeps you engaged right from the start when the action kicks off in Osaka, Japan.<br><br>The technical aspects of the film such as sound engineering, editing, direction, and cinematography are top-notch, as expected. (As I hoped)<br><br>The John Wick movies stand out from other American action films that heavily rely on CGI and poorly written scripts.<br><br>The John Wick franchise is a breath of fresh air with its fast-paced storyline, mesmerizing stunts, and remarkable choreography that leaves you in awe. The fight scenes featuring Reeves and Yen are breathtakingly authentic and captivating, unlike the unrealistic superhero movies.<br><br>In summary, John Wick 4 is a must-watch for action movie lovers as it delivers an exceptional viewing experience that you won't find elsewhere.</div>

Characters were like if they were written by a 10 year old and werent interesting at all, scenes were made Ok and cinematography was on point, storyline was the worst, movies was so long so slow and you would know how it ended before even a scene began. I dont know how this movies got this high rating 8.8/10, I wont trust these ratings anymore.</div>

Incredible world building, compounded by brilliant choreography, acting and script writing.<br><br>Every scene looks hyper real. Every gun shot, every punch, it's an art form. John Wick 4 neatly wraps up and incredible journey I didn't expect to go on. But I'm greatful I did.<br><br>It's the Die Hard of my generation and it's learned and matured so well. It's a visual spectical and I could watch it again and again. For me its a great start to cinema in 2023. It's got me excited for the next films I intend to see (Openheiner and MI).<br><br>Go see this movie and don't make the mistake I did, stay for the final scene after the credits!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">First one was good, 2nd was better and really good. Third was the best, so I thought, it's going the right direction.. I couldn't be more wrong.. First of all, what made the previous movies so great and especially the third one, was the details in the action scenes were so accurate.. All of the sudden in the beginning of the hotel in Japan, John wick kept shooting without reload, until he was alone there doing the shooting..? At the end as well.. 21 bullets in his gun. It seemed more.. Also again in so many movies lately, why exagérating so much and making scenes so long, especially during some dialogues.. You know what they're gonna say or what's coming.. And when he fell down the stairs at the end. That was so over the top and unnecessary and so unrealistic.. He had 8 minutes to climb those 222 steps or so, whilst kicking everybody's ass. 3 minutes to go and down he goes all the way to the bottom and start over, crawl back up, little dialogue with Donnie y'en and make it both in time..?? The director said he had to make movie this long to tell the story. That's not true at all. Story wise, it had no positive effect. He just put in more and longer action scenes.. Total let down when you compare it the previous movies. And very predictable also at some times.. This movie wasnt worth waiting so long and definetly not my money..</div>

Builds up on the strengths of John Wick 1 and John Wick 2 and fixes the flaws of John Wick 3. I really hope they keep this as the end of the franchise because the conclusion is just flawless where chapter 4 ties up everything together giving due justice to all its characters. Kudos to the director for coming up with this gem of a movie and the stunt crew for the out of this world stunt scenes and thank you Keanu Reeves for being Keanu Reeves. You have taken gun fighting and close combat action genre to another level!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">For years during action movies I've just wanted more action i.e. The transformers franchise and many others. John Wick 4 takes action movies to a whole new level. This movie is 3/4 action and its some of the best fighting and visuals I've ever witnessed in any movie. While a lot of it will have you saying to yourself, "there's no way he survives this", you quickly will remember that's part of the lore of the John Wick movies and you don't care anymore. Very solid movie and a hell of a way to end the franchise if they so choose (Hope they don't). My only dislike is the main enemy of this movie didn't get the violent and punishing death that he deserved, however it was satisfying when he did eat that bullet.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Let me start this off saying that I am a huge fan of this franchise. The first two movies are some of my favorite of all time. The third disappointed me story wise, but the action was incredible. This movie for me was the worst of the 4.<br><br>This movie is long yes, but that's not my main problem with the film. Obviously you need to suspend disbelief in these movies but the blind character was a step too far. I do not understand how this guy is shooting people, dodging bullets and not getting shot himself. The movie is also poorly acted, the worst in the franchise in my opinion.<br><br>I did not love the story either, the plot line with poker and the man who killed his uncle was insanely weird and poorly done. This world that we have experienced in the last movies has changed so dramatically. Overall heavily disappointed but there was some great action scenes. Also SPOILER:::<br><br>John wicks death was well done. A little abrupt but it was time.</div>

Keanu Reeves is always at his best here. But everybody here does shine in there own way, even two characters I believe that derserve there own spin off, you'll know them when you see them. I don't want to tell you anymore, but I'll say 4th time is the charm.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">You know you're in good hands when a film begins with Laurence Fishburne being used to explicitly shout out Lawrence of Arabia (I see what you did there, movie).<br><br>John Wick: Chapter 4 is more John Wick. It is likely exactly what you're expecting it to be, but if you're like me and you had high hopes for this fourth installment, you're likely to be pleased by what the film delivers, even if it doesn't entirely blow expectations away. The title character is once again put up against plenty of people who want him dead. The story is designed in a way to get him to travel to various locales, all of which are well-utilized in the action scenes. And when it comes time for those action scenes themselves, they're largely spectacular.<br><br>Things manage to escalate even more from the gleefully over-the-top Chapter 3, but I will say, the opening half-hour to 45 minutes of this proves to be surprisingly restrained. The momentum never slows down too much, but to some extent, it takes its time to get all the pieces in place. After that's done, things don't let up much at all, and I was glad to see the non-stop energy and fighting of the third film's opening act replicated here, except this time it plays out during the final act, and in a new location.<br><br>There were other key details I really liked. One action scene is shot in a way that looks like a live-action version of Hotline Miami, and the results are pretty great. There's also some really good music used throughout, including Justice's Genesis (not the only on-the-nose music choice, given they're a French House duo and the scene it plays during takes place in Paris, but it fits the heightened style of the movie).<br><br>You do feel the length at some points, and I don't think it's the best-paced recent blockbuster with a three-ish hour-long runtime. Still, it delivers stylish action, a high-stakes, kind of goofy, but engaging and simple story, and Keanu Reeves and a talented supporting cast all doing their thing. The creativity and stuntwork found in the action sequences are great, and it all adds up to what might be the best entry in the whole series (beating out Chapter 3 by a hair for me).</div>

And when you think you know what's happening next(other than another few hundred deaths) it takes a turn, again and again. Lots of stories inside the main story. Keanu is well great. And all the characters are there along with the whole host of new characters that spice up the stories, inside the story. There are some chuckles when you need them the most so you can exhale and take a fresh breath scattered throughout the film. Oh yea stay until the end of the credits!! Enjoy.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4: These aren;t fights, rather ballets are being played out as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and his friends fight off legions of attackers. Set piece battles take place in a hotel, a disco and in the traffic next to the Arc de Triomphe. The Triomphe sequence is perhaps the best as Wick has to dodge cars as well as waves of attackers sent out by the Table and attracted by the ever increasing bounty on his head. Wick is even half hanged in a Russian Orthodox Church in Berlin. Family, friendship and the comradeship forged in battle is important here, ties which have weakened must be rebuilt. Caine (Donnie Yen) is a blind assassin and old friend of Wick who is now forced to pursue him, A new bounty hunter, The Tracker (Shamier Anderson) complete with cute German shepherd (dog) is also on his trail. Most fearsome of his foes is the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) who dispossesses Winston Scott Ian McShane and destroys his hotel. This is a dark tale, while the sheer number of deaths may appear comedic the means by which they are killed and the graphically displayed aftermath will choke the laughter in your throat. But it's not just an action thriller, there are shades of paranoic conspiracy and existential terror which infuse this film. Some pretty good acting from Reeves, Yen and the ensemble cast. DDrected by Chad Stahelski and written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. 8/10.</div>

He was born for this role!<br><br>-The Osaka Sequence is God-Tier!<br><br>-Donnie Yen is the definition of cool!<br><br>-The Birdseye view sequence covering an entire floor of a building during a shoot out!<br><br>-The Flight of Stairs Sequence!<br><br>-The Cinematography is amazing! All the colors pop!<br><br>-The Pacing and Editing. Doesn't feel it's run time at all!<br><br>-The Duel Sequence!<br><br>-The Ending. Unexpected and Perfect!<br><br>CONS:<br><br>-It had to end.<br><br>This is the Apex Mountain of Modern Day Action Movies. These films have been an unexpected surprise and the people behind it have gone above and beyond, perfecting their craft along the way, to entertain the audience! In a world dominated by CGI Blockbusters, the John Wick films have been a breath of fresh air, relying on beautifully crafted stunt choreography, fantastic direction, and actors that came to play and who knew exactly what kind of films they were making. Chapter 4 took everything from the first 3 films and amplified it. I don't wanna spoiler anything here, as this deserves to be experienced first hand. Keanu Reeves was born to play this character and this is his best outing as the character yet! I can't say enough positive things about this film. Pure Action Escapism. 9/10.</div>

But this has become nothing but an action killing porn film. It wasn't even disguised that the plot is completely unnecessary and that every really cool backdrop, stylish villain, mystical dialogue is just filler for the ambiance. Mass murder takes place and bystanders don't even bother to take notice. They are just background dressing for the endless, nonstop choreographed fighting.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. The sets are beautiful. The wafer thin characters whom you know nothing about act cool. The dialogue about The Table and each other are mystical in a bad karate film kind of way. I had a hard time knowing whether this was just a parody of those films. And in the end, which is itself another endless fight that is clearly over the top (and our hero seems totally invulnerable like playing a video game in god mode), we have another end which... will there be another sequel?<br><br>I really miss the cool, badass with a couple of witty lines we saw from the first two. In this film, the only words I recall Reeves saying were a handful of items about the dead and... "yeah." Sums it up.</div>

I can't quite put my finger on it. The villain was definitely boring, the story line and dialogues seemed a bit stretched out. The fight scenes and overall feel of them didn't quite do it for me like the first 3 movies did. I think there's gonna be mixed reviews on this one. I felt there were several plot holes. And I'm in limbo about how I feel about the ending. It seemed fitting but then also didn't...? Lol. Idk man I just think some lazy writing went into play on this one.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is easily the best John Wick out of all of them and one of the best action movies of the decade so far. When I saw this movie, the theater was packed and it deserved to be. There were young people, old people, men, women, white, black, all kinds of people there who loved this movie and got a thrill out of it! The John Wick franchise and Keanu Reeves literally bring people together and action like this is what we need in our movies, real stunts on camera with real effort and without needless CGI! Donnie Yen killed it in his role and there are fantastic sequences that blew me away (the stairs scene, the Paris traffic scene around the Arc De Triomphe, and the ending duel specifically). The wet night club fight and the fancy Japanese hotel scene were astounding as well, and throw in the humor and the dog as the two cherries on top. Take notes Hollywood! And huge shoutout to Keanu Reeves for doing stunts and work like this at his age still, he's just as impressive as Tom Cruise!</div>

Last action scene is not impressive seems only for repeated for John Wick. Final climax is interested and watchable.<br><br>Acting Kanu Reaves is looking aged and tired. Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburn, Issac Mc, Riddick interesting. Surprise is Scott Adkins. He is looking very different apart from his macho image. High table and it's rules are not new we already seen previously. Here only locations different and authorised persons changed.<br><br>Overall movie is watchable once.<br><br>It is my first movie after two and half years due to my illness.</div>

The whole theatre bursted out laughing because of the ridiculous fightscenes. I am left so angry and annoyed. Don't you ever go watch this pile of poop if you like anything that is the slightest realistic. More unrealistic than Marvel movies. It has absoluty nothing to offer. A blind guy who can fight, shoot and play cards? What is this? Maybe 12-13 year old kids would find this movie cool. This is as stupid as it gets. John Wick says nothing in the movie. It is absolutely pointless and meaningless.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Fortunately, the John Wick saga improved in this film thanks to a continuous tribute to great film craftsmen. To make a film that is a reference, you must have the grace and charm of the classics, a superlative cast, an impressive production design, music according to the quality of the film, and a story that has no holes. Here everything is given. We find multiple recognizable figures that contribute not only from the physical point of view but also from an acting point of view. I must highlight the always correct Fishburne and McShane and the always nice Clancy Brown; However, the one who steals the film is the enormous Scott Adkins who can finally demonstrate in the big cinema what he is capable of. There are multiple plot lines (some more interesting than others), necessary tragedies for the progress of the plot, exuberant and often implausible physical display, and the magnet of having most of the great international action movie stars before us. The fact that the beauty of the locations impacts is based on the fact that if you want to give class to a film then you have to resort to that visual enjoyment that only places with history can offer. The movie pays homage to Peckimpah, Leone and many others who delivered the best movies for our pleasure. Well filmed, with careful shots, it is an enjoyment that is appreciated.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">In the whole John Wick movie series, this is the best in action I would say . The direction, stunts performed by Keanu Reeves is just mind blowing. Overall an action packed movie . And the perfect climax in a traditional way . Everything was just perfect. There are a lot of action movies out there but the what the action sequences in this movie are just impeccable . The collaboration of so many good actors make the movie even better. Donnie yen did a really good job playing a character of a blind contract killer . I have no regrets watching this movie on first day first show . Lastly I would say MUST WATCH!<br><br>Baba yaga has its own way to make you satisfied with his action .</div>

John wick ki shuru ki 3 movies ki to hipe thi hi bhot mst thi. Pr ye bali last bali guys mtlb John wick ki hipe ko bilkul hi top pr le gyi hai. Guy's kasam se behtareen movie hai. Guys bs ek bar jao yar dekh ke aao review kya pdh the ho. Pagal ho jao ke John wick ke liye ye movie dekhne ke bad yar.<br><br>A sensational entry into the action heavy franchise that is "John Wick" &amp; quite possibly the best action film in years.<br><br>Keanu is an extremely underrated martial artist and actor for his disciplined techniques. He definitely deserves all the praise for his stunts as-well. I go into each JW film with an open mind of appreciation for the martial arts &amp; fight sequences, the films are guilty pleasures to me as I can't take them seriously at all. This is not a shot at the film or it's direction, having camp is not a bad thing though. Mr Wick has surely come a long way since losing his dog &amp; wife in the first film. Regardless, definitely will always be there day 1 for any Reeves film and can easily say this is one of his best ever put to screen.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.<br><br>The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.<br><br>One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">There is no action franchise more beloved than John Wick over the past decade.<br><br>John Wick 1 was a good balance between Action and Story. John Wick 2 was also a really good movie ( In my opinion ) After John Wick 3, it starts to lean more and more towards the action side and not focus so much on everything else.<br><br>John Wick 4 is a relatively long film. I think a total of 2 hours just fighting and shooting duels.<br><br>John Wick becomes a bit too much of a superhero in the sense that he lives being run down countless times, falls 20 meters onto the edge of the roof of a car. And the sequels he gets up and walks away.<br><br>What I liked about the old movies is that he was Badass but it was still realistic. He kills 150 people in John Wick 4. It's becoming too much of a superhero movie for my taste.<br><br>Another thing that I thought was mysteriously thought by the director. Is that when they shoot and throw axes at each other's heads in a nightclub, almost no one reacts to it.<br><br>And when they shoot with machine guns and other weapons in the middle of the road around The Arc de Triomphe are there no cars that speeds up or slows down. It is as if they are not there at all.<br><br>John Wick 4 is like riding a roller coaster. It's fun at first, but at some point, you just want to get off the ride.<br><br>I give it 5/10 due to the fact that it manages to make a decent story for it's 4th of a franchise.<br><br>And because I love Keanu.</div>

The way they go about telling the continuation of this "Ghost looking for his graveyard" is phenomenal. The new characters are all extremely exciting to watch and lovable. The choreography of the action sequences is fantastic and you can easily tell how much work was put into them. The camera shots (especially one in particular) were absolutely genius and beyond what I could have expected. This movie is fantastic. Everything about it is a fantastic way to end the story of John Wick. The ending. Wow. Although sad of course, it is a happy ending. It is all we could have asked for as fans of these movies.<br><br>This movie is a must see and is (IMO) the best John Wick movie they have made.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Alright, so I saw John Wick 4 last night, and I feel like it's my obligation to issue a fair warning... it is not as good/perfect as the "ratings" want you to believe. Read the negative reviews, they have merit.<br><br>Before going to see Chapter 4, I rewatched the first 3 and was totally swept off my feet, again! The 4th is a redundant, emotionless, farcical disappointment that fails to advance the story, yet alone resolve it. SO MUCH POTENTIAL after the 3rd one to witness John recover, exact revenge on his betrayers, and peel back the curtain of the high table: doesn't happen. Weak-weak-weak storyline with plot contrivances galore.<br><br>There is only one action scene that stood out that is maybe the most memorable of the series... and one driving scene with some of the sickest tracking shots I've ever seen... but just be prepared to watch hours of nonsense for those 15 min of magic. But was there cool fighting throughout? Yes, but it falls flat because it is so absurdly unrealistic and tedious without any grounding sense of purpose. Not trying to deter you from seeing it. Just advising you to lower your expectations so that maybe you can enjoy it for what it is.</div>

Of course, the scenes were very good filmed, very amusing and exciting, watching it in cinema was not a waste of time, but after some time, I felt we are watching same thing as happening in other movies, I don\t want to get into more details, so I don't spoil the movie. The movie definitely worth watching. Maybe I had something in mind about the way the event could evolve, but this is my personal view, my son liked it, it was good father - son time in the cinema. .</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is the fourth film in the John Wick film series. The film is again directed by Chad Stahelski, who also directed the three previous films.<br><br>The price on John Wick (Keanu Reeves) continues to rise, prompting more and more deadly opponents to take on him. As John faces off against these new enemies, he also tries to regain his freedom at The High Table, but this demands a lot from him and he can trust fewer and fewer people.<br><br>With this fourth John Wick film, they are going bigger again with more different types of action. For example, this film contains good and different types of action scenes in succession, which they have put together in creative ways. The film can be reminiscent of The Raid action films where you get to see more action than a real story emerges in the film. This is such a fun and entertaining movie for fans of brutal and entertaining action movies. The movie is also set in different places around the world. This way you get to see a beautiful and creative background where the characters compete against each other. Fights take place in an Asian museum, in a dance club and around the Arc de Triomphe.<br><br>Due to the long running time and the further lack of a real story, this film sometimes comes across as empty in addition to its action scenes. You learn a little more about the fictional world in which the John Wick films take place, but most of the lines in the films are not always easy to understand. In some scenes where two enemies are together, you don't always understand why they don't kill each other immediately, but take on other opponents first.<br><br>At the age of 58, Keanu Reeves still manages to deliver entertaining and believable action sequences. Even when he takes blows, he often still manages to defeat his enemies. He has also done most of his stunts himself and only uses a stuntman when John Wick is hit by an enemy car, for example.<br><br>It is also nice to see Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick back in their well-known roles from the series. They know how to portray their well-known roles in good and recognizable ways. It's just a pity that Lance Reddick passed away suddenly earlier this month.<br><br>Of the many newcomers to the John Wick world, enough know how to steal the film in their moments. Bill Skarsgård plays more of a somewhat corrupt businessman who tries to arrange everything from behind the scenes to deal with John Wick. Shamier Anderson plays more of a mysterious hunter, who neither John Wick nor you as a viewer are ever sure if he can really be trusted.<br><br>Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen bring a more Asian fighting culture to the John Wick world. Both portray different Asian fighting styles and cultures in the film. For example, Hiroyuki Sanada plays a more wise, honorable warrior, who knows how to take out his enemies in clever ways. Donnie Yen plays a blind character again, just like he did in the Star Wars Spin-off film Rogue One. Despite this handicap, he again portrays his character in a believable and dangerous way.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the saga of the legendary assassin. Keanu Reeves delivers another stellar performance as the unstoppable John Wick, who faces his most formidable foes yet in his quest for vengeance and freedom. The action sequences are breathtaking and inventive, showcasing the skills and charisma of Reeves and his co-stars, especially Donnie Yen as Caine, a blind former colleague of Wick who becomes his ally. The film also expands the mythology of the John Wick universe, introducing new characters and locations that add depth and intrigue to the story. The cinematography, music, and editing are all top-notch, creating a stylish and immersive experience for the viewers. John Wick 4 is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike. It is a rare example of a sequel that surpasses its predecessors in every aspect. I give it 5 stars out of 5.</div>

It's the finale, and a great one.<br><br>Minor complaint that John, as in all installments, but greatly seen at the third one, takes too much abuse and handles it just fine --- he just limps in pain and that's about it.

                <div class="text show-more__control">Best John Wick Movie so far. More actions in the movie. More interesting story. And mostly the last battle that's like the cowboy movie. 1v1. Men to men. So many places to get highlighted. And for god sake John Wick is frkin immortal. Enemy keep missing shots after shots. And there is Donnue Yen. One of my favorite actor. The battle music is very great. And mostly I like the part when the camera rotates like a FPS Tournament. They give you some rotating sort of effect and a top camera view. Totally like FPS tourney'and yes John Wick still love dogs. Best 2023 movie so far. But sadly it showed that Wick is dead. But hey, gotta be another movie because, Wick once faked his death (kind of). So looking forward to next part of this movie (If it's really another part).</div>

The fight scenes were well choreographed, however that's all the film is, just one fight after another with Reeves surviving clearly unsurvivable situations, to the point where the audience was just laughing. If it is meant to be a comedy, then it isn't that funny, it this is not a film that you can take seriously either!!<br><br>Won't be watching any more Wicks films, that's for sure. Highly disappointing trip to the cinema, which in any event is rare these days, as so many films are below par.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I still remember exactly the atmosphere in the cinema lobby when I wanted to go to the cinema in 2014. At that time, I had no plans at all what film to watch, so I finally decided to watch John Wick after seeing Keanu starring in him, I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. Also, I don't know what the film is about, what genre it is.<br><br>After dozens of minutes of watching, I was dumbfounded. John Wick's character is very unique as an assassin -melancholy, his heart is soft so he can cry sadly, his nature is serious and quiet but sadistic and cold-blooded - and his gun-fu action is very cool. Of the hundreds of films I've watched since I was a child, none of the martial arts action films are as good as this one.<br><br>A month ago, I purposely re-watched JW123 before watching JW4 last night which I've been waiting for since last year, to refresh my memory so it's more connected with the storyline. The result? Very satisfactory. JW4 is better than all three. Better in terms of selecting new supporting actors, cinematography, storyline, action choreography and in terms of Keanu's acting.<br><br>1. Brilliant selection of new characters.<br><br>Of the several new supporting actors, Donnie Yen brilliantly managed to play a very significant role in building the story of JW4. His acting is flexible, his appearance is cool, his action is cool, and his refreshing sense of humor helps reduce tension while watching this film, which is about 80% filled with gun-fu scenes. Previously I was a little disappointed with the selection of Mark Dacascos in JW3.<br><br>2. Beautiful cinematography.<br><br>If you pay close attention, there are a number of things related to cinematography that are relatively different from the previous three series. Starting from the sound system, lighting techniques, color themes and shooting angles. There are a number of scenes that remind me of the Matrix trilogy, including fights under a fountain that looks like rain and a scene at a train station. And the most special, the angle of shooting a la bird view in a fight scene.<br><br>3. The storyline is more natural with a perfect ending.<br><br>The outline of the story is about John Wick's efforts to free himself from the pressure of The High Table caused by his own actions, breaking the rules by killing Santino D'Antonio in The Continental of New York hotel. At first he had thought of killing all members of The High Table, but his close friends opposed the idea. The ending of the story is perfect, but it's better if I don't tell.<br><br>4. Better duration, level and beauty of gun-fu action.<br><br>The duration of the film is almost three hours. In some scenes, I almost felt bored, but the director cleverly stopped it and moved on to another scene at the right time. The fight choreography feels more beautiful and seems natural.<br><br>5. Acting Keanu Reeves.<br><br>In several scenes, John Wick's expressions and body gestures are clearly seen to be exhausted, moreover his opponents are really tougher. On his face were lines that showed he was on the verge of despair. This acting is the main part that makes the ending of the story perfect.<br><br>After watching JW4, regardless of whether there was an intentional element of the story writer and director, it's as if JW123 was deliberately made only to form the perfection of the JW4 film. So, it is only fitting that JW4 will be flooded with praise from film critics such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Most likely this film will become the Top Box Office.</div>

This installment blows all of the other movies out of the water with the action scenes and it mixes it perfectly with story telling. I would love to see them take this series forward but if this movie were to be the end of the franchise i would be content. This film has made me want to rewatch all of the other films to really get the full experience of the story as they pick up where each one left off. This movie is a must watch masterpiece of a film; john wick if he returns out of the shadows again I will certainly give that one a watch too.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I was starting to get a bit tired from this franchise, despite me loving the third movie, on some rewatches, it felt like the only thing happening were action sequences, and they were still very impressive and memorable, its just that 2 and a half hours of that gets tiring at some point and I was a little afraid the same thing was going to happen here and on some degree it does, the action sequences are still very impressive and epic. But sometimes they last a little more than what they should, but this movie has much more story than its predecessors, now John Wick has more of an objective than just kill whoever tries to kill him, here, he really has a chance to be free again and with the help of other characters who also have better motivations in this one, he plans on getting it. Obviously the best thing of this movie are the fighting scenes, combined with their awesome cinematography, music and choreographys it makes for a great experience. I already talked about some some of them lasting a bit too much but that doesnt affect the film as much as it could have. And in this one, we have a more clear villain, who you hate from the first scene from which he appears, he is bad. Elegant and menacing, he is awesome. The side characters and new ones introduced are also very interesting and entertaining to watch, mainly Cain, who I hope gets a spin off or something. And all the movie is like this, the best quality of action a movie can have but stopping at the right times so it doesnt get tiring enough. And finally I want to say that the finale was the best it could have been for this saga, the tension depsite not being a fight is the greatest Ive ever felt watching these movies, you are genuinly terrified from whats about to happen, and you dont want to watch the outcome but you have to because its where everything gets defined. It is definitely, the WORTHY ENDING John Wick deserved.</div>

The Wick movies are action packed and well maintained at that point.<br><br>The thing I don't understand is that he is a Baba Yaga, the boogyman, but still he is not hard to find by killers. He kinda is a step backwards compared to the men who want to kill him. There is no boogyman anymore. He is shooting at men, they are shooting back, but nobody shoots him in the head.<br><br>The scene in the building from above was amazing. It looked like a John Wick's version of a Franklin mint clue game.<br><br>John get fired at, besten, thrown out of a building. But because of the kevlar suit he is like a duracel bunny; he just goes on and on. Yes it is fun to watch, but not very believeable. Storywise and for the action; fun to watch.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Okay this movie is INSANE. Insane cinematography. Insane lighting. Insane sound-design. And most of all, insane action -the good ol' gun fights, hand-to-hand combats, sword-fights, everything short of tanks and fighter planes. This is everything the previous movies were, but the duration is 2x. That said, you'll still have to give it all the cinematic liberties to enjoy it thoroughly.<br><br>Keanu Reeves did exactly what you've seen him do before, nothing new, but twice as much. Special mention to Donnie Yen for the role that he was given. Rina Sawayama, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins, were GOOD additions.<br><br>There may come a point where, if you're not a John Wick fan but a regular film lover, you MAY feel "Okay, dude. Stop fighting and move on to the next thing." But if you're a fan and enjoyed the previous ones, you'll have a ball with this movie.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie is exactly what Stahelski had in mind and dreamt of when developing John Wick. This movie is an absolute loveletter to this whole franchise. It looked back at JW 1-3 and what made this franchise great, took the absolute best and made it even better.<br><br>The stunt choreography and coordination was always a highlight in John Wick movies, but this movie was able to build an astonishing almost frightening good momentum. "Momentum" not only for the stuns themselves but also for the viewers. Momentum and flow is what made this movie truly great.<br><br>The cinematography was my personal highlight. Not only was is it able to pick up and greatly reinforce the momentum of the stunt choreography, you could clearly see that every shot and every scene had its own personality and felt unique. With sometimes completely bold and unusual but extremely refreshing perspectives and memorable scenes you would not have expected or even thought of. You could describe whole scenes not by their stunt choreography but by the genius camera angles, cuts, snaps and so on.<br><br>This movie sets a really high bar not only for the franchise itself but for all other movies coming this year. By far the best movie in this franchise. Anyone who remotely enjoys and loves to watch JW should watch this movie, without any questions whatsoever.<br><br>Close to perfection: 9/10 (since 10/10 is never reachable)</div>

The acting felt like they paid to be in the movie instead of being paid.<br><br>None of the characters have a strong presence or elegance unlike the first movie, dialogues include a lot of "f you", "get your ass over there" etc doesn't feel like a John Wick movie at all. John Wick just says "Yeah", "I understand" etc like someone's b*itch.<br><br>The only good part is hopefully they won't be making progressively worse movies to milk money off the name anymore.</div>

John Wick concludes it's chapter by seeing how pissed off John is. The only way to freedom is a old traditional duel. However John must get past a thousand men army and fight his way to freedom in time or he will be executed. John is amazing, Donnie Yen, Tracker, and Marquis are great enemies of John Wick. All are motivated by their own personal interests.<br><br>The movie was 2 hours and 49 minutes. I was so intrigued with the movie I had no idea how much time passed. It had the right elements and I was intrigued by every scene. Thank you for making this series a great experience! It was fun.</div>

<a href="/review/rw8953036/?ref_=tt_urv" class="title"> The best fourth installment to any film franchise. Hell, it's just one of the best action sequels ever!

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick is a funny franchise, and its origin is pretty funny too. People underestimated the first John Wick movie when it released in 2014. It just looked like another throwaway action movie with Keanu Reeves in it, but Keanu Reeves has an appeal all on his own. He has been criticized for his level of acting skill for as long he has been in the industry for since the late 80s, but he certainly isn't a terrible actor. Sure, his emotional range might not be the best of the best, but he still manages to give fine performances none the less. I thought he was pretty damn good in Speed as a passionate cop who just wanted to help people, and his anxiety outburst in The Matrix when he learns the truth was memorable as well. Anyway, people underestimated John Wick 1 and because of that, it seemed to exceed everyone's expectations as a well-directed action/revenge flick and also showcased a deeper side of Keanu's acting ability.<br><br>Anyway, after the success of the first film, it was obvious that a sequel would follow, and that's exactly what happened, and then a couple of years later there was a third one and suddenly it became a trilogy! The two following movies changed tone a little bit and became more avant-garde than the original, but these two movies improved on the action and took it to new levels.<br><br>Now that the fourth chapter is out, it once again brings the quality of action to new heights and now brings it closer to perfection than it ever has before. The action in this film is insanely well shot and directed and is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying. The several action sequences are very lengthy too, with a couple going for over 10 minutes. The last time I saw an action sequence go for this long was in Mad Max: Fury Road almost 8 years ago, and it's pretty obvious that they took a lot of research from that film and how it was crafted. But here's a hot take, I think John Wick 4 is even better! Because unlike Fury Road, it has a story and characters that are on the same level as the action!<br><br>Every character in this movie is extremely rootable and has their own weaknesses and limitations, there is a blind character in this movie who is an extremely good fighter... but he's still blind and uses sound emitting sensors that he sticks to the walls, so he knows exactly where his enemies are in space, and I thought that was a very nice touch. John Wick himself is also very skilled at hand-to-hand fighting and shooting, but he also isn't a perfect fighting god and will be outsmarted sometimes. The Yakuza leader who ran the hotel in Osaka was great too, and his character was also built in the same way where he had his own strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>The characters are also very compelling and is clearly shown what each one is struggling with and also showing just how broken as a man Wick is at this point. A certain character changes sides but I won't spoil who. Also, the villain was also pretty good as well. He didn't really have that much of an understandable motivation; he was just ruthless and nasty and that's all he really needed to be. You don't need to explain an antagonist all the time, sometimes they can just be evil for the sake of being evil and that's fine and can also work as being entertaining. He was an intimidating presence, unlike Agent Smith in Matrix Resurrections which was a joke compared to Hugo Weaving.<br><br>Anyway, I was completely blown away by just how good the action was in this and just how long it went on for without becoming boring. It might just be one of my new all-time Action Favorites and highly recommend that you go see this on the big screen with the best sound. It really was a masterpiece of action with a great story to back it up!</div>

I want to say he wanted to retire again, or wanted some exposition, or wanted another photo of his wife, or something. It doesn't really matter, it was just one long fight scene of a movie, like Shoot Em Up but less fun.<br><br>The fourth one was weak again plot-wise, but that's expected by now. And the motivation was unclear again until the third act, and seems to be wanting to quit killing people by making it abundantly clear that he is just trying not to die by making it as likely as possible he'll die and trying to quit killing people by killing a hundred people...<br><br>It was fun to watch, but is nothing more than that. An action movie about action movie stuff, with some fig leaf excuse for the action movie to occur.</div>

Amazing stunts done by Keanu Reeves that I consider one of the best action actors, Bill Skarsgård is good but there is something in there that makes me feel weird, good characters. Amazing sequences of action with some sequence shots that are absolutely fabulous. Good story, well developed. Some bad dialogues, some towards the end when it tries to be very epic and dramatic, it is but more when it does not try to be. Good ending to John Wick.</div>

Where was THE John Wick?!<br><br>Now, we talk about the ending.<br><br>What happened John? The other guy had the same wounds as you did and you died, or did you "die"? Either way coming out of that movie theater I felt like something was missing and I've come to the conclusion that a lot is missing.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Only 2 good boss fight scenes and they were not the main boss or the 2nd main boss. There is boss fight between two sub-bosses there is so out of character of the character development created for them just before the fight that it spoils the special ending.<br><br>Endless mob grinding while spamming potions and abilities. If you play any MOBA games you will understand. Magic jacket need magic weapons of +5 or higher to hit (AD&amp;D reference). Only armour thicker than his jacket is his plot armour.<br><br>Bad plot writing, b grade action movie ending, c grade special ending. Bad directing, bad pacing of mob clearing, bad cinemography. I joked with my friend that they will try pad out the movie with 5 minute scene of people eating or siting. There were 3 definite moments of these of which when they start he couldn't stop laughing looking at me.<br><br>The actually padding out of a movie that would be at most 1 hour and 40 minutes long was done with the mob grinding scenes. You see John take his cosmos pistol (a gun with endless bullets, Captain Harlock reference) when plot requires him to toss it use his character hot bar skill to obtain another one.<br><br>There is feeling of risk even when John gets visibly tired, he just hot bars his stamina potion and is good to go.<br><br>Pros: Donnie Yen total character commitment in center and off frame of his scenes. He has total commitment to playing a blind person and not some blind kung fu master. You will see him in the side frame continuously shooting in the general direction of an enemy he kills because he doesn't know if he went down and is dead or is touching and tapping with his sword the environment as he moves to make sure of his surroundings. He even sometimes looks the wrong in side frame when people are talking because he is not Dare Devil.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This movie is phenomenal. Keanu's best acting in my personal opinion. So much words of wisdom said and yet so much actions done at the same time. It's a realistic movie, not just your typical action film. John Wick is a man of reason. There are a few comedic banters in the film that just make it so much better. I'm usually the type to not finish a movie in one sitting. I easily get carried away or bored, but this masterpiece right here kept me entertained for three hours straight. I was laughing, I was scared, I was weeping, and I was serious. So many emotions for one great film. I rarely give 10 star reviews but this one deserves it most. You know it's a 10/10 if you're willing to watch it over and over and over again, and still love it every single time. Amazing film! Highly recommend watching! Great end to the series! Also Bill Skarsgard is incredible in this film, do watch it, no regrets at all I swear.</div>

The choreography is even better than the previous 3 films. The acting is even superb despite the other films lacking in that category, I was actually emotionally invested in this story more than I usually am during a movie and I walked away dumbfounded by it's surprising excellence. I would not have expected an action movie from a series known for being over the top and goofy to be such an incredibly well done movie, but it was. That being said, the film still manages to be quite funny and whimsical at times and is still over the top like John wick should be.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Welcome back, Streamers! As has been highly-anticipated, our favorite dog-loving, retired hitman is back in action this weekend. Yes, John Wick resumes his quest to be free from the tyranny of the High Table and all of its bureaucratic, bloody nonsense while continuing to grieve the deaths of his beloved wife and his adorable pup from Chapter 1. These John Wick movies usually have great fight sequences, good visuals and pulsing soundtracks - that's why we keep coming back, so let's see whether Chapter 4 delivers.<br><br>Do I really need to explain the plot of John Wick: Chapter 4? It is very much a continuation of what has come before. Keanu Reeves returns as assassin-extraordinaire, John Wick. Wick runs afoul to the High Table once again, which puts him back on their radar. The High Table holds Winston (Ian McShane) accountable for John Wick's actions and puts another bounty on Wick's head. John Wick goes from location to location and from elaborate action sequence to even more elaborate action sequence for more than 2 and a half hours to avoid death and gain freedom. Gun-toting hijinks ensue.<br><br>First, John Wick: Chapter 4 is too long. There is no reason for this movie to be almost 3 hours long. The plot is not that intricate. In fact, it is basically the same as all of the other movies, except the first one, which was really driven by the grief and revenge of the John Wick. Two hours definitely would have gotten the job done. Even though the action sequences are entertaining, they can get overlong and become very exhausting. I can't imagine being Keanu running from place to place, fighting, shooting and falling all over the place. Bless his heart. No wonder he sounds so out of breath.<br><br>What you really came to John Wick: Chapter 4 for is what it delivers in spades: exquisitely elaborate action set pieces. The movie takes place all over the world, and each location looks beautiful and interesting. There is such ornate and complicated set design, and you know it's especially fragile so it can get destroyed with all of the shooting and fighting. And, these sets do, indeed, get destroyed. There a multiple shoot outs that take 20 minutes, or more, each. It can get fatiguing because once you've seen one shoot out then you've seen them all, but John Wick: Chapter 4 shows that not all elaborate shoot outs are alike. Thankfully, this movie has a good sense of humor as well.<br><br>Ultimately, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers the action, dry humor, beautiful shots and elaborate set pieces that we have come to expect from this franchise. Keanu Reeves shows up and puts himself through it. While the story is basically the same as all of the other John Wick movies, it is still as entertaining as ever with clever stunts and even some good musical moments. I'd say it's totally worth a trip to theater with a big box of popcorn.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I walked out of theater for a film with so many hype and so many fake fans they know john wick if your happy with the ending fine with him dying your not a real fan unless you thinke he survived.<br><br>John Wick the man the myth the legend dies from a gunshot wound exactly where the doctor in 3rd got shot. Rambo got shot in the same shoulder he surivived the doctor survived. Not John Wick hereis the thing about action movie hero they are not supposed to die they are supposed to live. John Wick he died for nothing he dident take down the hightable his friend Donnie Yen probaly going to kill the friend he sacraficed his life for. Johns life is for nothing who did he save the trailers made us think he will take down the high table we could have had endgame moment where thousands of assasins fighting armys of high table forces. They killed of Charon which is bad because his death was for nothing. End of the day we havent even seen who is the true head of the High Table we got another villian like the ajudicator whose roles mean nothing. Not just the terrible ending the action is rushed. One and two the action was more slower and more focused. They are doing these fast shots if they making a pg 13 movie. Donnie Yen is not utilaized he is know for hand to hand not a gun and knife. 5 was supposed to be filmed at the same time as 4 canceled that plan because of covid are you telling me John true bad guy is covid 19. The thing I am worried about is that they will replace Joh n Wick with Ana De Armas or the new girl Akira if thats the case why is everything killing of male charachters with female nobody wants a MSHEU. This can be fixed bring Keanu Reeves back I will give this a 6 out of 10 do not come with the excuses he is old Tom Cruise is older and he going to keep doing stunts until he dies. This is not how a man , myth the legend is suppoded to die he is Baba Yaga not some cry baby who died after a shot to the shoulder. Watch this at home if your desperate to see it.</div>

John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is not only the best movie of 2023, not only is it the best movie of the John Wick Franchise, but it is one of the greatest Action Movies of all time &amp; is possibly the greatest movie that Keanu Reeves has ever done in his career.<br><br>The action &amp; violence is outstandingly phenomenal! There are so many phenomenal standout action scenes, that I can't name all of them. One of my favorite scenes is where they are paying homage to Cowboy Bebop.<br><br>So if I didn't sell you enough with those statements, John Wick; Chapter 4 (2023) is a masterpiece of the action genre. It is the best movie of 2023 &amp; I believe that no movie will even come close to besting it for the rest of the year!</div>

</a>            <div class="display-name-date">
                    <span class="display-name-link"><a href="/user/ur87775878/?ref_=tt_urv">dandantimes</a></span><span class="review-date">22 March 2023</span>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">The latest installment of the John Wick franchise is a cinematic masterpiece, with phenomenal cinematography and choreography that will leave you mesmerized from beginning to end. Director Chad Stahelski pulls no punches, delivering a gun-fu epic that is not just a series of combat scenes, but entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography and synchronization required is simply incredible, and the film continues to find new ways to entertain with kills, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, and much more.<br><br>What really stands out, however, is the dazzlingly lit environments and the music that kicks as much butt as what you see on screen. Many of the action scenes take place at night, and the lighting is simply stunning, resulting in a visually stunning film that is a feast for the eyes and the ears.<br><br>The introduction of new characters in this world, including Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama, adds to the excitement and makes for an even more enjoyable experience. While Keanu Reeves may be less nimble at his age, he still manages to deliver an impenetrable force that is a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>While there may be some plot armor to forgive, the longer takes and overall action sequences make up for it. This is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, and you won't even notice the 169-minute runtime. If you're a fan of the franchise, you won't be disappointed. But even if you're not, the phenomenal cinematography alone is worth the price of a ticket.</div>

Nothing.<br><br>I understand John Wick itself is a genre but pushing a genre to it's extreme with total lack of sanity is nothing but treating the audience as fools. And thinking that your audience will watching anything that calls itself John Wick and has Keanu playing the role is disrespecting your own audience.<br><br>I loved the first John Wick. It has human emotion in it. But this Chapter 4 is nothing but a video game. What a mess!! Total nonsense.<br><br>Keanu. Wrong choice man.<br><br>SMH.</div>

I can almost hear the boardroom discussing how to make this movie end in such a way that it will provoke strong social media reactions, possibly igniting sequels and spinoffs.

They really leaned into what truly works in the John Wick franchise and went full-throttle on it. Non-stop action.<br><br>The best of the franchise by far. I wasn't a massive fan of the 3rd movie so for this one to rebound and really kickass is awesome to see.<br><br>I can think of multiple sequences in this that are easily some of the coolest scenes I've ever seen in a movie.<br><br>The story isn't perfect and there are a few bits and pieces that I didn't particularly love, but the overall epicness of the movie trumps any flaws it has. The runtime was a bit long but they make the absolute most out of that 2 hours and 40 minutes.<br><br>This is one of those movies where you are truly left wondering how they pulled off certain moments.<br><br>The ending was also good enough to bring it all home.<br><br>Favorite scenes: nunchuck fight, traffic fight, over-head shot of gun fight in house.</div>

The Immortal Baba yaga is back to get his freedom back and ready to kill anybody coming his way. With the addition of new characters, there is no way this franchise is going to end with this film. This movie has raised the bar in all technical aspects whether it's sound design, cinematography, editing, production design. Overall, it's a must watch for action fans. Watch it in biggest screen possible with Dolby sound. The very first scene will make your heart thumping. Donnie yen excels in all the scenes he features. All characters played their part well. Just go and watch this once in lifetime experience.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">The John Wick franchise has provided memorable action scenes and have propelled the uber-cool and super charismatic Keanu Reeves to new heights. Nevertheless, this movie in some form undoes what previous chapters have painfully built.<br><br>The story is unnecessarily convoluted and way too long to be entertaining. Motivations come and go, with no real substance rather than to keep the plot running. Most annoyingly perhaps is that action scenes feel somewhat recycled. For instance whatever was cool about animals in chapters 2 and 3 is rehashed here to little innovative effect. Even the actual physical setting: an early scene in the movie takes place in what felt like a too familiar museum-type of place with lots of neon lights and warrior masks and armors behind glass boxes. It's like things that were cool and worked out previously are just brought again. Lots of characters that are important to the plot, appear and disappear without having ever been mentioned before, creating some horrendous plot holes. All in all, it seems that there is so much that is forced and just "more of the same" cash-generating formula.<br><br>All of this would have been overlooked, if the characters were a little more real and less "Fast and the Furious." By this I mean that the action scenes and apparent immortality of certain actors have so much more in common with Vin Diesel and his gang than with earlier John Wick movies. No one important dies easily and there's a point that the logic of how someone can just keep going defies any common sense. Nothing feels at stake since you feel throughout the movie that John Wick will just keep going, not by sheer spirit and determination (as it was before) but rather by super-human abilities that, let's be honest, are just dumb.<br><br>As an audience member, I felt to some extent disrespected. The action and story in itself is so ilogical that there is no reason anymore to think more about any of these characters. Ian McShane's gravitas is lost. He's just playing the same role, saying the same things, looking cool, but adding so little. Same goes for Morpheus, sorry, Laurence Fishburne, who just do the same he did but somehow now in a different location.<br><br>All in all, a franchise that ran out of ideas and while beautifully filmed and with some exciting scenes, defies logic in so many ways it is hard to keep yourself interested or invested.</div>

Some of the tight fight moves were off the chart and Reeves athleticism is incredibly impressive.<br><br>The card playing scene was pure genius. The overhead cam shot scene in the old building was revolutionary and expertly choreographed. The negotiation for the specifics of the dual was wonderful too.<br><br>The idea of a blind assassin was also fresh and the ultimate dual scene was very well handled.<br><br>However, much of the rest was so repetitive it became not only boring to watch but irritating. Watching the same gun, knife, roll, fall etc 150 times is just pointless and boring.<br><br>The penultimate scene of JW getting up the steps to the dual was painful beyond belief. I mean come on ffs!! We've watched him spend the last half hour moving a mile and kill 200 men...just get there already.<br><br>JW 1 was so fresh and new its sad that we have now ended up with an hour of amazing cinema and nearly 2 hours of what looks like a kid playing a first person shooter.<br><br>Maybe the US audience love this stuff but for the brits it would be nice if they could edit out about an hour of the repetitive and unbelievable nonsense as it had so much promise and yet fell so short.<br><br>Usual problem of studio giving production total freedom to do what they like. Money money money over finished product.</div>

I can't believe this movie was that good and I'm so happy it was so good. I love all the new characters introduced like Caine, Mr Nobody and a lot more other characters which were super enjoyable to watch and I began to like these characters quite a ton. I feel like some people won't like the ending of this movie but I think it was super well written and a great way to the end the movie. Keanu Reeves was such a badass as John Wick yet again as he was so damn cool and great to watch in this movie. Overall this movie is quite phenomenal.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Wow, it had really been a while. It had been a while since I was so engrossed watching a movie in theaters. That's what I thought to myself walking out of the cinema hall after watching this. Of course Avatar was beautiful and had some great visual effects but it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. John Wick: Chapter 4 really turned out to be a great sequel amidst all of us wondering if they were stretching the franchise too much.<br><br>This movie purely stands out from its predecessors and also from most of the action movies these days because of its 'execution' (see what I did there ;-)). The story isn't anything really out of the box and it is yet again John Wick running away (and killing away) from the lot trying to kill him including the high table. The screenplay is very engaging and it almost acts like going through different levels of a game before meeting the final boss. The action set pieces are very well executed just like many other John Wick movies, but in this film the attention to detail to some of the action is at a different level. I ended up laughing at some of the action sequences just because how outrageous they were and in a good way. My brain was just unable to comprehend that level of awesomeness. The fight scene in a Berlin nightclub is probably one of the best action sequences in a movie and the background score makes it special. The action sequence around Arc De Triomphe is ridiculously good and makes you feel like you are in a fantasy ride. The cinematography is outstanding and offers some very creative perspectives in some scenes, which are worth the big screen experience. Background score and music selection is near perfect and as mentioned this film checks pretty much all the boxes in the technical departments. Another big highlight of the movie is the choice of beautiful locations. The filmmakers have made sure to give a new experience despite choosing many of the mainstream action movie locations.<br><br>There isn't much that does not work for the movie. The script isn't very new and I personally feel that some parts of the plot weren't really justifying what happened next. Sometimes, the action sequences may feel a bit too streched but that is mainly dependent on an individual's taste.<br><br>Donnie Yen's characterization as Caine might feel inconsistent at times related to his abilities. It also reminds you of Chirut Imwe from Rogue one but the chemistry between him and John Wick works out for better eventually. While Bill Skarsgard's character is intentionally obnoxious and irritating, it doesn't really create any kind of a significant threat. The antagonist and supporting roles are very well written and never get overshadowed by John Wick. Clancy Brown as Harbinger in a small role is very impactful and Marko Zaror as Chidi, the right hand man of the main antagonist is immense. Scott Adkins as a heavily prosthetic Killa offers a unique comic relief but also a unique resistance to John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada is his usual best even in a small role and Rina Sawayama as Akira is definitely a future star in the making. Old timers and franchise veterans Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne are pleasant as always. And the main man himself, Keanu Reeves, offers great depth to the character and delivers as many punches as he can but very few lines ;-)
Last but not the least "the concierge" Lance Reddick (god rest his soul) delivers one last classy short performance with his trademark deep voice.<br><br>John Wick Chapter 4 is a stylish, compelling and an unapologetic action flick which makes for a great theatrical experience.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I saw "John Wick 4" yesterday. It is more of the same (and much more) from Keanu Reeves as the titular character. It has Mr. Wick flying all over the world encountering numerous villains who have been set upon him by Marquis de Gramont (played by a deliciously evil Bill Skarsgard). The action set pieces are well done and there are plenty of exotic places to feast your eyes upon like the Osaka Continental and a bizarre Berlin nightclub. Plus, there are ingenious ways for a blind nemesis to fight off attackers. The other actors are fine including the usually reliable Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburn and the late Lance Reddick. And Scott Adkins is perfectly awful as the grossly overweight and terrifying villain "Killa". Those are the good points, but here are bad points - the movie is overlong at 165 minutes. Many of the fight scenes are repetitive and add nothing to the story except extend the run time. So, I while I enjoyed the movie, it could have been edited down to about the standard 2 hours without damaging the storyline in the slightest. I think the high rating in IMDB is unjustified at 8.4, and I would rate this one at a 7/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Don't be fooled by the other reviews praising a film that reflects no appreciation for originality and authentic film making.<br><br>Chapters one and two have really been closed off with a load of rubbish for the last 2. Just a money maker now. Shades of the Fast and furious franchise. Poor story line, no purpose, makes no sense and a really pointless conclusion. Rips off the warriors classic with a stupid black American radio host (in the middle of Paris) 🙈😂. Extremely poor writing.<br><br>Very very poor film. Reeves could dodge bullets in the matrix, then stop them. No need for that here, as every bullet no matter how many or how close seem to miss. I would have thought a crossover with marvel might be on the cards. Considering every person seems to have Vibranium weaved into their suits. 🙈<br><br>Class fight choreography, props to the stunt team. Except for the occasional henchman who stands there watching Wick kill his colleagues before lifting his gun after 5 seconds, perfect timing for a John wick reversal. Or a kick that somehow causes Wick to fall down 3 flights of stairs. Keane Reeves definitely has a career as a pro football player, the amount of rolling he does down those steps. Got a few laughs out of the crowd. 😂😂<br><br>You honestly do have to be quite simple to be impressed by a movie of this quality. But "Such is Life" When it comes to the standard of film making now a days.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick did not disappoint with his action again. At least for me. In my opinion, this series is pretty safe. He can do action scenes and that's the main thing for me and I was entertained the whole movie. Add to the fighting and shooting a hilarious soundtrack and the fun was taken care of. I've heard a bit of criticism about the length, but I was fine with it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I also praise the surprise ending. I thought the fourth episode was very good. But after some thought, I'm still leaning towards the third one, which charmed me with its action a bit more than here. The locations were also great and I liked them a lot, but I will mention the third part again, which appealed to me more with its setting. I don't have much to add. John Wick is a luxury action series for me and probably always will be. The action is the main thing here for me and it succeeded this time and once again I praise the surprise ending. For me, a great film that I recommend to fans of the series or action genre enthusiasts.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick: Chapter 4 is a movie that adheres to the expectations of those who have seen the franchise's earlier instalments. The film's runtime is nearly three hours, and it does not disappoint when it comes to action. The movie commences with John Wick embarking on a battle against a group of assassins pursuing him. John Wick's combat skills are honed, and he quickly dispatches his opponents. The High Table, a group of powerful individuals, appears, and their leader declares that John must die. Caine, a former colleague of John's, is recruited to assist in John's assassination. John must use all his abilities to stay alive, but the odds are against him.<br><br>The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with some of the most excellent stunt work seen in a long time. There is plenty to see for those who appreciate gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. The stunts are impressive, and the choreography is immaculate. The action in this film is so captivating that viewers will be on the edge of their seats for the entire movie. The scenes come thick and fast and are continually building up to a climax that is nothing short of unforgettable. The actors deliver outstanding performances and excel at bringing their characters to life. Although the storyline is satisfactory, the film's final moments are particularly noteworthy.<br><br>The movie felt a tad too lengthy and stagnant in certain places. Some of the fight scenes feel repetitive and are repeated several times throughout the movie. Nevertheless, John Wick's fans will undoubtedly appreciate this film. Be sure to see it on the biggest screen available to you!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick: Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lover's wet dream. The cinematography is Oscar-worthy, and the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colors make each scene pop. The action choreography utilizes 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knives, nun chucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stunt work is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, especially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the movie. It's pure gold."</div>

The fact that Chad Stahelski delivers a film that is high-octane ride that makes you feel like your jumping off a plane blind folded while listening to AC/DC - Highway to Hell, on meth(might have pushed that metaphor too far), is no easy task, but sometimes I'm pleased to be proven wrong. It's hard to believe this film ran at almost three hours and I was worried that the action would leave me numb and it did, but for all the right reasons. John Wick: Chapter 4 has the simplest of stories, a bounty on our protagonist and the longer he stays among the living, the higher the bounty rises. Let's be honest, nodody went to this for the story, we went to see Reeves bust down doors and brake some bones, and that is where the film really delivers. In this day and age where half the films are poor comic-book adaptations, Chapter 4 is refreshing to see. Personally recommend watching it on the biggest screen you can find, that's what I did.<br><br>Story: 6/10 Characters: 7/10 Visuals: 9/10 Pacing: 10/10<br><br>Overall: 8.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Honestly, I feel like the title to this review is enough. The fight scenes in this movie are the best they possibly could be. These are the kinds of stunts where I could see Tom Cruise watching this film in theaters and going, "Challenge accepted."
The best word that comes to mind to describe the first few action set pieces is: "beautiful." I realize that what was happening on screen was very violent, but the movements and the methodical timing of them reminded me of an intricate dance, and I mean that in the highest of praise.<br><br>I feel like the word masterpiece gets tossed around a lot, but this movie is a masterpiece. I believe this will become the action movie to beat for a while.</div>

The acting from everyone is phenomenal and Donnie Yen is on another level for me. Bill Skarsgård is also a fantastic actor and his turn as Marchese de Gran just shows yet again how much talent he has. I remember the first John Wick coming out and at the time, we knew nothing about it. By the end, we were blown away. I got the same feeling all over again last night. The fight scene choreography is very real and done very well. As always, Ian McShane puts in a stellar performance and the way he says 'Jonathan', just takes me to the fair lol. A movie that I'll happily watch in the cinema again and enjoy every minute of.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable"><ul><li>John Wick 4 gives it all with its never-before-seen action stunts that will take your breathe... literally. There are some stunts that are fresh from the oven, it's the first time it's been done in the history of filmmaking. The pacing is frenetic and the action sequences are jaw-droppingly awesome, you'll never get enough of them.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>A special shoutout to the cinematography team. Every time Mr Wick is punching, kicking, smashing and every other verb you can think of, the cameras have their ways of putting us on a ride; like a curious kid standing close only feet apart watching everything happening before his eyes. It is breathtaking, it is vibrant and it really feels like we're there with John Wick.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Some may ask if the franchise is getting ridiculous since it has now come to the 4th entry. Well, it may have come a long way as the start of the franchise was a revenge made because of a dog and a car but we will deny anyone saying it's starting to become like the F&amp;F saga. John Wick 4 still very much relevant and it stays true to what the franchise is about, but only this time it is bigger, bolder and more brutal.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Chapter 4 does not only offer violent fighting pieces, but somewhere in-between, you will find a meaningful and fascinating story of humanity. The thematic elements of friends, family and honor are the central aspects, proving that even with its bloodbath, pornfest of violence, the movie still cares about pouring its heart and love from these human values that we cherish.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Focusing only on a few characters, their motives and agendas are what made the story moves forward. Each character has something they want or need to do to survive and the stakes are high because everyone here is formidable.</li></ul><br><br>However, because there isn't many long-running characters left, it may be a drag for some audience. John Wick 4 isn't the same like the other 3, it is heavier, bloodier, and its neo-noir looks are refined and richer, it'll make you feel you're watching Blade Runner 2049 instead. Some will appreciate its tonal shift but others won't accept the new look, feel and heavy-themed stories.<br><br><ul><li>We cannot overlook at the fact that some action scenes are heavily choreographed to the extent that it may take away some of the good experiences as you may be aware of the idea that it looks staged. Yes, all John Wick films have great stunt choreography and there are times where it felt like they overdid some scenes, putting them in a way that felt like it's not realistic. However, this entry has the most unnaturally stage-like scenes especially the first major battle scene that takes place in a building.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>A lot might disagree with our opinion here but man, do we feel that the action here isn't enough. 2 hours 49 mins but there are only 3 major fighting scenes. We love all of them but honestly, we're expecting so much more. We went in thinking that the fighting part will take about 70% of the movie, with a lot of early reviews saying that it is a non-stop action film. But we're let down by the amount of action scenes. So folks, don't go in with a high expectation that there's gonna be a lot of fights. There are plenty but it's just isn't enough for us. We want more.</li></ul><br><br>Verdict: Defining the action genre, John Wick Chapter 4 offers an orgy of violence, nail-biting kinetic action sequences that will set the bar for the rest of the one man army movies in decades to come. It may not be THE best John Wick film but WOW, this is first class entertainment at its finest.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick 44 because once you have seen one, all the rest are pretty much the same. It's sad that this is all Hollywood can come up with. I suppose if you check your brain at the door, you can sit back and enjoy it. But the idea that someone - who isn't a "superhero" can endure beatings, gunshots, and getting run over by cars - without missing a beat - is a little too ridiculous for me. The several hundred thugs who are sacrificed are much the same, until the inevitable head shot. I'd say this review contains spoilers, but if you've seen any of the John Wick movies, nothing written here should come as any surprise.</div>

John Wick 4, like 1-3 before it, is pure entertainment.<br><br>Everything in this movie not only "works", but it wraps up one hell of a four-film ride. From the opening scene to the closing credits, John Wick 4 met and exceeded all my expectations. That was no small task - not because my expectations matter (they don't), but because this movie had to tie up a lengthy, complex, and ever-growing story in a way that honores the quality of the first three films while doing what each John Wick film does best, making a unique story fit perfectly within a broader movie universe.<br><br>I can't promise you will love this movie as much as I do, but I can promise, if you are a fan of John Wick, you will absolutely love this film and you won't spend $16 any better way than buying a ticket to see this masterpiece. Go watch it!!</div>

John Wick 4 achieves the difficult feat of being the best entry in the series, four films deep.<br><br>The action is taken up to another level, the world expanded and best of all for me, we get a number of really interesting side characters who are unique in their own right. This all means that you feel immersed into the world of John Wick and the High Table.<br><br>You do need to suspend belief whilst watching John Wick. He's almost at superhero levels and it feels like John Wick could give Neo a run for his money at this point. There were some sequences that made me think his character was invisible despite the filmmakers doing their best to shown his vulnerabilities.<br><br>That being said, you know what you are getting when you watch John Wick. That action is intense, visually stunning and team pulled out some unique sequences. I didn't feel the almost three hour run time. This will be a delightful watch for action and John Wick fans.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie is essentially an over-zealous action montage where a story has been shoved in to excuse the action- the writing even fails at that. The cinematography and stunts are pretty good, especially the birds-eye action sequence.<br><br>I feel as though this has been transformed into a fast and furious movie or Tug Speedman's Scorcher series.<br><br>Donnie Yen is a fantastic choreographer and to have him blind in this was nonsensical- a jack of all trades blind assassin....<br><br>Mr. Nobody could have had more potential instead he has a bit of an identity crisis- it all went down the drain when he wimps out to the Marquis, took away his mysterious badass tracker persona.<br><br>What is the point of Morpheus in this? He has had a build up for a while and has now transformed into Johns suit and gun supplier? More wasted potential.<br><br>The world building/lore is still very weak- there is so much interesting potential here instead we are just given one liners and are expected to eat it up. Fillers for the next bang bang scene to see John using his trusty suit jacket collar shield.<br><br>Clearly, the writers just solely focussed on the action, sure it looks very cool at times but when you show too much of something it takes the magic away. Using the excuse 'this is a john wick movie' is irrelevant, compare this to the first two and think. If you want to hail this as the best action movie ever you may as well hail Fast 9 as the best too, both are akin. All flash, no substance.</div>

This movie is violent and pretty long (2 hrs, 45 mins).<br><br>Background music, sound effects, camera angles from the top view during fight scenes are simply astounding (watched it in Dolby Atmos screen). The entire theater was reverberating with amazing sound effects, with plenty of goosebumps.<br><br>Climax is at its best and could be debatable.<br><br>Keanu Reeves delivers an skillful art through death defying action stunts. His hard work can be seen during every scene.<br><br>Donnie Yen brings his best with his casually cool action sequences.<br><br>This movie is for hard core action oriented, eye popping, patiently waiting for a long action sequences, and lots of logic kept at home type of fans.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">The first movie had so much more than this. I was genuinely surprised by that first movie: original, exciting yet realistic fight sequences, a main character and plot you were invested in, and although Keanu isn't a great actor, his lack of dialogue and a great supporting cast more than made up for it.<br><br>The 2nd and 3rd movies took us on a journey into this mysterious underground world, but set up more than it delivered. The action scenes were starting to get a little repetitive and unrealistic, but the intrigue of the plot kept us interested.<br><br>My expectation was that this movie would deliver a lot more with regards to story, but it fell flat. Nothing that was set up previously was resolved in a satisfactory way. The action scenes were ridiculous, the characters unoriginal, and the movie was just way too long. I was literally yawning as hundreds of supposed hit-men who couldn't hit anything were killed again and again.<br><br>Before this 4th instalment, I was thinking of adding the John Wick franchise to my Blu-ray collection, but now I will just buy the first one as it works well as a standalone movie and is far superior to the rest.</div>

It is simple continuation of the last chapter but some "tweaks" needed. Yes, the last scene will shock you for sure but without it you will need to want more.<br><br>Yes of course, whatever shown in the first 3 episodes are summarised and when John is dying in the last scene that won't make you cry but will make you want him more and a sence of relief that he is now free from all the BS he faced.<br><br>So overall it is a good movie, I would love it more if the fighting scenes were taken in a different way than they did in the last 3 chapters. Some new angles, slow and closeup scenes etc will make it a lit.</div>

None of the first 3 movies deserved 10 but this one was so bad. Wasn not fun, was not exciting, was not deep. It was nothing. I still have to write 350 characters but honestly there is nothing else to say. John wick 4 is a bad boring movie l. And I really hope this was the last one. There is obviously nothing else to do or show or shoot or make. Keanu is a super nice guy and I like him so I hope the movie will make enough cash. But it beyond my understanding how could some many people give it 10 points!</div>

The story begins at nowhere
And of course it ends at nowhere<br><br>The fighting part is a little bit boring
NPCs wait for a long time to let the main actor kill them
To be honest
The suits of the NPCs are quite nice
But to be honest
The sound is good<br><br>However The music part is awful
When it use a piece of Chopin's No.20
The music has been swiped into pieces
The violin was all wrong, even the move can't match the back sound
Make me to lost concentrate on the movie<br><br>The move and the music is totally different
I suppose at least find someone who can actually play violin
It's not a hard job.</div>

The story line to date isn't overly engaging or riveting and that is why they're great and thats why they work. John wick has found a way to offer the action film fan, endless gore and viloance without some BS effort to be overly clever. The 4th instalment offers more of the same, but bigger and better. It can be cringy in parts but who really cares, the amazing fight scenes more than make up for it. I think if you loved the first films you will also love this one. Not sure what's in store for the future of John Wick.....as I've said already, hopefully more of the same.</div>

Maybe he was on Redbull all the time. He was missing shots in the clear desert area but was accurate when it comes to a crowded club. Apart from him no one was capable to shoot accurately the whole time like a bollywood movie. Hand to hand fighting scenes are repeated. After leaving the theater I didn't feel anything for the movie. Director seemed to be racist as he shown all the whites were enemies for wick and at the End a Chinese guy and two black guys on his sidewould say it's decent remake of any advanced video game.</div>

I think this movie is better than all john wick movies and some action movies, how it is better? This movie is funny than all previous john wick movies and action scenes is amazing (Cinematic,Production etc. Is also great). For sure this is a great movie but it is not good enough. Some scenes such as the Shimazu dying scene is not sad as the scene intended, because, this movie is a lot more action scene that make the story progression slower and make the movie longer and make it a little bit boring.

One of the most mediocre films not only in the series, but also for the action genre.<br><br>There's no franchise more scrappy and likable than the John Wick movies of the last decade. The first film, 2014's John Wick, was a low-budget affair, helmed by an unproven director, stuntman Chad Stahelski, and starring a then-unbankable Keanu Reeves. The movie did OK in theaters but found a more appreciative fanbase on home video.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This fourth chapter adds almost nothing to the John Wick franchise, born somewhat by chance and became a cult narrative for action movie nerds without thickness. The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Dude I just saw this film last night and it was absolutely phenomenal. The fight scenes were so cool especially the shotgun dragons breath scene where the camera is looking down into the building and follows Wick from above as he lays waste lol. It was a little bit dragged out though. I liked it don't get me
Wrong but I think it would've worked completely fine had it be 2hrs30mins in runtime. Some of the fight scenes give you a beat to relax then start back up. The whole Osaka Continental fight scene was so cool with the arrows. Donnie Yen is a beast too. Especially in the Osaka scene. My only gripe with the film, which I understand at Keanus age and stunts can be taxing, is him phoning in his performance. Even with the first Wick film he was more animated. Especially in his movies before then. Like look at the first matrix even and then put his performance here aside it. You'll see he had more emotion back then. Yeah you can say it's "the character" but even with the latest Bill and Ted as well as Matrix 4, he seemed to be phoning them in as well. So idk but regardless I would see this movie in theaters. IMAX would be best.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This Chapter 4 of the John Wick saga is a true masterpiece.<br><br>There is a lot to say about, but from the richness, depth and variety of the characters, to the obvious search for iconic visuals that imprint your retina to forever leave a mark in your memory... There is this lore and deep mythology, with its codes and numerous complex links... Which all make for an extremely tasty action movie, that offers martial arts and/or action scenes that are equally groundbreaking and unique in the way that it renders and impacts your experience as a movie viewer. There clearly are three-four long sequences that make you feel like you're witnessing something special... It's intense, creative, beautifully shot, nicely paced and of course perfectly staged. The photography is exquisite from beginning to end (it puts you in awe a couple of times)... And the whole piece is magnificently served by a plethoric cast of very very high quality...<br><br>It might be pure action, but like the greatest adventure-action movies in history, it has several powerful sceneries/settings/locations that obviously add-up to the fine taste the movie leave you... Also, the few story bits that punctuate the movie are a delight that thickens the whole experience, leading the way towards some cool twists and outcomes...<br><br>Overall, a true masterpiece, for sure.<br><br>This Chapter 4 of John Wick very much places itself in the heights of Kill Bill 1&amp;2... And might be remembered as a classic in the history of high quality action cinema.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick Chapter 4 is easily the greatest action movie ever made and for me, one of the best movies ever made. Not only does it have varied, high octane, insanely choreographed and nail biting action. It has side characters with emotional beats, that despite its extremely fast pace doesn't sacrifice it's heart.<br><br>The film is a non stop thrill ride, with one of the best finales ever. It was so intense in the final act I felt like I couldn't breathe at times. The writing at the end in particular was great and didn't 'betray' the rules of the universe or the table.<br><br>Overall, just do yourself a favour and see John Wick 4. You will not regret it.</div>

Sadly, I missed the post-credit scene, saw it on the YouTube.<br><br>This movie has raised the standard of action movies and set itself as a new subgenre.<br><br>Also, I just found my new hobby: reading 1-star/negative reviews and their reviews of other movies. They give a new perspective and its fun seeing how they have rated other movies, compare it to yours own. Hahah.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">* Is this one of the best action films? - Absolutely!<br><br>*Is this the best Martial Arts film? - YES! In Hollywood!<br><br>*Is this the best solely action film of Keanu Reeves? Perhaps! I like Speed (1994) much more than everything else.**<br><br>*Direction:
It's exquisite and surely an improvement over previous installments. There's more room for long continuous fight scenes and the car sequences are awesome too! The whole top angle fight sequence was so much fun to watch, and if you want more of that, go watch Brain De Palma's SNAKE EYES (1998).<br><br>&gt; At 169 minutes, it's surely over-long by at least 20 minutes.<br><br>*Plot:
The story is engaging but doesn't elevate itself with multiple twists and turns, much like the previous installments. The villain is somewhat dumb and we always know what'sgoing to happen next, even if we don't know how it's going to happen.<br><br>&gt; Plus point is it keeps getting better and the ending my even be the best part of the entire thing.<br><br>*Cast:
**Donnie Yen as Caine, the blind High Table assassin is the only fresh breath in the film making it entertaining, exquisite and emotional.<br><br>**Bill Skarsgård as the Marquis acts fine and dresses and better although the script doesn't allow him to be as sharp as literally any other character.<br><br>**Rina Sawayama as Akira has so much potential for possible future projects, but here she seems to have been nowhere near utilised.<br><br>**Reeves is of course the back bone of the film, giving his Career Best Performance!<br><br>* Costume design:
In my opinion, the best part of the film. Especially that of Marquis, putting a richness to the whole thing.<br><br>* Cinematography:
Almost every frame is breathtaking and justifies being set in night. Paris looks as beautiful as it did in classic Audrey Hepburn films (Charades (1963). Like the first 3 chapters had colours GREEN, BLUE &amp; RESPECTIVELY, the YELLOW shines here. The stairs, the sunrise, the traffic, all are pleasing to eyes.<br><br>* Ending:
&gt;The ending could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as (SPOILERS) John died like said, or didn't and yet faked his death and went somewhere to avoid the underworld life and all the bounty hunters (like in Sherlock Holmes, where he is seen at his own grave).<br><br>&gt;Though some are calling it the best part of the franchise thus far, I'll still place it second following Chapter 2.<br><br>&gt;P. S. no offense to John Wick, but this film shows him a whole lot more invincible than even he is supposed to be capable of. Surviving multiple bullets is one thing, but falling from high story buildings onto metallic vehicles, and falling 200 steps? As a good film, this one deserves to have been somewhat more grounded or logical.<br><br>* Overall:
&gt; My rating: 7.6/10
&gt; Rotten Tomatoes: 95% Fresh, 8.2/10 avg rating
&gt; Metacritic: 78.</div>

Best cinematography and action sequences. Also, locations and ambience in the movie were really good. The tone of the movie was serious business. Unlike other John Wick chapters this one contains some funny parts, which is a plus. Background music is just same as the others, and really suits to the style and action. Best chapter in all JW series and it is a must watch.<br><br>Also, this JW chapter does travel across multiple nations and involves different characters from different ethinics :)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I have to start by saying this movie is not that bad movie, had to give only one star because this is really overrated, when i write this, this movie has 8.6 stars, i think 6 is correct for this movie. So we waited many years to see this movie and what disappointment this was compared to prequels. There was zero emotion in this one, really stupid plot because how the movie ends and the outcome would have been same if he hadn't killed the manager at the start, so when the movie ends you are kind a left with the disappointment feeling that this is why i watched almost three hours this endless repeating action movie, but this is not the worst thing about the movie... Donnie Yen charecter Caine is blind and still shoots in a pistol duel and all bullets hit the target, he magically knows playcards what he has in hand when playing poker and the church staircase scene was laughable, it's like 5 year old boy would have written this movie...fighting scenes are silly, there are many enemies coming everywhere, but still john fight mostly one on one and the others are just goofing around in the background waiting their asses to get kicked. John survives huge drops, hitting by a car and immediatly continue fighting again... prequels had way better action scenes and way better emotional John Wick, this wick seemed like he was lost...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Just watched JohnWick4, long-awaited action franchise movie in 1st day-1st show here in Nepal..🇳🇵<br><br>This movie has so much full of action-packed sequences from the very start to the end, I didn't get time to sit on my seat properly.<br><br>Director Chad is highly acknowledged for his actions in past JW series, and he again scored his best to this movie.<br><br>All the action sequences are spine-chilling and the audiences love to watch them mesmerizingly.<br><br>This movie takes us to travel most of the world's famous places, and finally to Paris. And it shows Paris so beautiful, never been seen in any other movie before.<br><br>The level of direction, the cinematography and props used in the movie, and the sets were highly impressive!<br><br>But, there should be some less men should die in each action sequences to atleast 80% as of in the film, and then the bullet-proof suit should not save/protect JW from such huge rounds of bullets in the action.<br><br>When John said Winston to write 'loving husband' in his grave if he dies makes me feel so emotional.<br><br>Keanu as John Wich again truly deserve in the role. He looks like actual Mr. Wich more than a character.<br><br>Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hopefully watching it once again in coming days.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">But still a good film. The originality of the John Wick movies was the realism ( or as close as possible ) of the action scenes. In this 4th movie the images and the sets are better but for a grown up, the fight scenes are sometimes hilarious in every way possible. Also, the fact that Caine is blind erases by half his credibility ... a must not have done in my opinion. Thumbs way up for Bill Skarsgard and Shamier Anderson. I don't know if they should have stopped at the third, it is still entertaining but it takes a down slide road of the saga. Not even close to the second, which I think it still is the best of all 4.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie defines the action genre. This movie is made to watch only in cinemas or you will be cheating to yourself. The action sequences were madness and a lot of stylish music and settings were there throughout the movie. Never seen more stylish movie in all sense from start to finish. The theme of John Wick as a God was still intact as he just couldn't die and everyone fears him. Even a city full of people couldn't kill this mad man. Only thing I don't like about this or few other John Wick movies was that he doesn't has a motive to not die. A back story why he is so damn robust could be shown or maybe in future installments.<br><br>One crazy casino scene was so mad and my absolute favorite which shows the ridiculousness of this franchise which is so uber cool. Only madmax fury road was another mad movie like this in action genre. If this is not the best action movie ever than definitely not far behind either. There is only one way to watch such movies and that is in cinemas.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">A true John Wick fan here. Unfortunately, this is the least of the 4. What I liked about the other 3 was the close combat and the sheer bruteness of how kills where portrayed. 1 is a 9, 2 is a 10, and I give 3 an 8. S if I give 4 a 6, it says it all. In John Wick 4 it is more in the open and it just doesn't feel the same. The fight scenes are just not as good as in the other movies. It's a decent film, especially the scene with Scott Adkins is good (he steels the show, give this man a spinoff or his own movie), and the scene with the shot from above is awesome. The cinematography is great, but I go to John Wick for the kills (who doesn't) and it just doesn't give me the vibe that the other movies had.<br><br>However, a must see if you want to get closure for the franchise.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Saw it yesterday at the cinema. Well, I can't quite agree with the praise.<br><br>The film is clearly too long, the action scenes all get out of hand and you only see more of the same killing scenes, which are boring and tough in the long run. Less would have been more here.<br><br>Attention, there are a few spoilers to a few fight scenes.<br><br>Chapter 4 takes the "nonsense" to the extreme again. I'm a fan of well choreographed fights, but not when it's just overplayed to the max. John Wick once again fights HORDES of assassins and walking fortresses, but they are all too stupid to hit John and always miss. It's also interesting that John Wick must think he's Neo, since he's constantly "dodging" bullets by ducking and taking slight sideways steps. By John being invincible, it's just not fun to watch him kill, because it's unsatisfying victory, kind of like a cheat in a game or some kind of god mode. It would have been much more intense and emotional for me as a viewer if John was significantly more vulnerable and if there had been more noticeable character development and motivation. It would have been enough to reduce the kill count from over 200 to under 20, but to stage the individual fights more brutally, more intensively and, above all, more realistically and credibly (e.g. As in Atomic Blonde or Mission: Impossible).<br><br>I also find these "armored" suit guys stupid. John often shoots whole magazines at these guys, and the bullets bounce off the suit as if the outer fabric was already made of 1 cm steel. But the fact that the suit guys are still very agile is even more laughable. And the suits are still as clean and intact as if they had just been bought and ironed. These suit guys don't have head protection, though, which is why I find it ridiculous that John imemr shoots at their bodies and not directly at their heads. He seems to be shortsighted, because he only ever shoots at the head when he's extremely close to the enemy. However, when enemies wear complete body armor including ballistic helmets, John strangely always shoots at their heads even from a distance, until after ten or fifteen shots he finally shoots into the helmet/head from below. If you multiply these kind of kills by 100, you have an idea of how often John kills hundreds of killers in the same way.<br><br>Furthermore, I find it very nonsensical that there are no police in the world who intervene at times.<br><br>The scene in Paris at this big traffic circle with several lanes is also totally crazy. John and the killers shoot at each other on the traffic circle for over ten minutes, and the "civilians" just drive on like robots at 50 km/h and just keep running over some killers and John, though John never takes any damage from it. But no one stops, gets out and runs away in fear. The traffic keeps flowing, despite wild killing by shooting and wild running over.<br><br>As for the staging of the action scenes: For every well-staged action scene, there are unfortunately three mediocre and boring action scenes that always follow the same pattern, see my comments above. And even the best action scenes are not necessarily as "groundbreaking" or "novel" and "groundbreaking" as some critics claim. I found a whole two action scenes very successful, once the much too short! (where all the others are way too long) chase scene in the Mustang and once the top-down fight scene. The highly praised staircase fight scene I found again much too long and also very 08/15, because John again makes his always same kills, while all the others always hit only the staircase railings or lanterns, but not John.<br><br>The story isn't worth mentioning and doesn't make much sense in terms of content. Interestingly enough, the nice dialogues and dialogue scenes are still one of the best things about the movie.<br><br>The sound is well mixed though, the camerawork is well done and the visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and there are a few nice references to Matrix (rain fight scene and the train station).<br><br>Now all of this sounds rather like a poor or mediocre rating, but that wouldn't do the film justice. It offers good entertainment on a technical level above mediocrity and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch. Therefore I still give it a solid rating, despite all my reservations.<br><br>Rating: 7/10 points<br><br>Rewatch Value: Low<br><br>Emotional depth: Low<br><br>Lasting impression: None.</div>

May seem far fetched, until you sit in the theater and watch this unbelievable movie. There is simply not a movie that can compare to the action displayed in this film. Unbelievable choreography and stunts, plus an amazing hit man storyline.<br><br>This movie shows the true capabilities that John Wick has... and also introduces some awesome new characters, and every character is perfect fitted for this movie. I don't see one thing in this movie that was bad and I highly recommend it to any viewer that has the chance to watch!!</div>

Much sleeping . One person puked from the constant action this movie kept throwing at your face . If you like pointless fights with a lot of violence , bad acting and terrible written characters , this movie fits right up your alley!

                <div class="text show-more__control">Remembering John Wick the first movie I was enthralled by the mysterious, feared and shadowy Mr Wick who offered up intrigue and overwhelming focus for revenge. The skills and fortitude presented by the character added the action to an action movie.<br><br>The following movies John wick -4 SERIOUSLY lack in any sort of storyline except guns, killing and an unrealistic ability to not get shot dead in a hail of a million bullets fired by 'professional' Sicarios.<br><br>The latest instalment was absolutely no different, the storyline is weak and boring, the main character must be a god to not die in the usual hail of bullets AND being run over more than 3 times.<br><br>TBH I towards the end in the stairwell scene I was WISHING someone would just kill the John there and then, after all he's just fallen hundreds of stone steps, gets up and starts again... Total Bull.<br><br>The usual bull of the good guy being able to kill a hundred hardened criminal well armed fighters just to be thwarted by a single unimpressive and willowy man is rife within the movie industry, Its a shame they also applied such a ridiculous storyline in this movie.<br><br>Thankfully then end scene was a total surprise, that part alone was worth the price of the popcorn, but not the hotdog!<br><br>THANKFULLY his character is dead.. Or is he?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The best fking movie in all of the John wick franchise .Action sequences top notch , got a 15 minute continuous one take action sequences. This film got guns, cars , dogs , class , suit and motherfking iconic characters .The action done by Keanu Reeves was the best . The director's love for neon colours is clearly seen in the movie and the all the mythology about the high table, continentals about different hotels throughout the world the leaders who control it the rules on which this big assassin world works which the high table even cannot defy. The tone of the story is set from the start by the death of two important characters we know this time that the stakes are real and it is the best one till now .<br><br>Those who cling to death live. -John.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.<br><br>The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.<br><br>One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story.</div>

All of them are superheroes with build-proof bodies or dresses, which is dame comedy.<br><br>Three long hours of killing without any acting, and the only purpose is it kills, but everyone will keep him until the end, oh God. John wick started with the killing of his beloved wife's gift "The dog" which is a great comedy but good to watch the action. This movie's action is directly taken from the video game is too much. They target the gaming group and not the other action movie lovers but why do the reviews and rating groups consider this movie as the best is rising big question.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">If you're a fan of the JW franchise than you're fan of the entire franchise and this movie will not disappoint. It does start off a little slower than the last movie as far as the insane action but It's one of the best written JWs yet(at least in my opinion) and the story is partially why the action takes just a hair longer to get to. But not to worry cause the action comes and it comes strong! By now we all know what to expect from the JW movies and if we are watching them, it's because we enjoy what they offer. For me this movie is one of the best written as far as the story goes. I truly enjoyed learn about the parts of the table previously unknown. I'm not sure how I would feel it they ever did these movies without Keanu (as a spin off or something, not even sure I'd give them a chance.) I think when Keanu is done, they should do what a lot of studios don't do and Call It a Success and Say Goodnight! Leave this one be to remain one of the greatest action Series in cinema... Go see it and enjoy.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick 4 is an exceptional addition to the already gripping John Wick series. This movie is undoubtedly the best modern thriller that you can watch and and the best one of the series. Without revealing any spoilers, I can confidently say that the action sequences in this movie are some of the best that you will ever see. The top-down action sequence was particularly awe-inspiring, and it made me feel like I was playing AAA title like Max Payne 3. The way the action scenes are choreographed is simply outstanding, and it is something that has become synonymous with the John Wick series.<br><br>Overall, I would highly recommend John Wick 4 to anyone who is a fan of action movies. The level of excitement and intensity that this movie delivers is unmatched.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This Film is packed with great amount of action with a tiny punch of humor and remarkable storyline. There are lots of moments when the audience would spontaneously cheer up between the scenes. John Wick films have a great thing as it progresses with every sequel and Chapter 4 doesn't fail to do so, instead it's the summit of all 4 movies. The end of the film synchronize with perfect ending for great story. The screenplay, direction and scenes keep getting better and better throughout. As they say what makes action scene perfect is background music and the team has gone limitless to provide so with intense action music that won't let you blink your eyes. Overall it's a must watch movie for every fan as well as those who seek to enjoy action films.</div>

Blindman appears to feel where are distant people to shoot but he can not feel where is JW even when he is breathing heavily next to him. 20 people shooting at him (some even wait for their turn) and none of them can hit. In conclusion all the shooters were blind, drunk and drugged or wind have blown the bullets away. Sadly, at the end a man who survived all the impossible things even for a movie dies from superficial wound.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">No spoilers here but wow! Amazing! I was very disappointed with John Wick 3 and felt the series declining, this is a complete step up from that film.<br><br>I love my action films, especially martial arts and this has things I've never even seen in Hong Kong action cinema before. So glad Donnie Yen also was able to shine, I expected him to have a few scenes then be out but he's along for a large chunk of the film without giving anything away. The choreography is on another level and blows everything else out of water. The story is also well written and there isn't just action for no reason. I recommend watching in IMAX if you can.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Amazing movie in every sense of the work. More action than any of the other Wick flicks let alone any movie of all time. Great mix of storytelling drama, action, big name actors, soundtrack (omg), cinematic landscapes, combat, weaponry, blood, guts and more. Spectacular performances from all stakeholders including Ian McShane (Winston) who seemed to steal the show in every scene he was in. Donnie Yen was also incredible. I deducted 0.5 stars simply because the limited involvement of Lawrence Fishburne. He was missed. Other than this there are disappointments here. They went all in to produce this one and it is a masterpiece!</div>

I can proudly say that this is the best action movie i have ever seen on the big screen. Nothing can be compared to it.. must watch movie..Keanu Reeves' exceptional performance takes the action sequences to an entirely new level, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Well I went to Montmartre and the Sacré Coeur today, just to make sure, and let me tell you it isn't exactly like in the movie. Even at 6 am you'll find the stairs full of random dudes playing djembe and sleepless students drinking cheap beer waiting for the sunrise. It would actually have been fun to include them in the final scene, but what do I know?<br><br>My real problem with this film though is that JOHN WICK 4 is so detached from any kind of reality it makes it a rightful candidate for the fantasy genre, what with its HIGHLANDER-friendly references to "consecrated grounds", love of stylish church interiors and absurdly invincible, nearly-immortal characters. Ok I actually kind of like that part, and I expect new installments to reveal that Da Vinci, Rambaldi (ALIAS) or the Knights Templar started the High Table organization, which would be fun.<br><br>No, my real quibble is when the gun play becomes so fantastic than they can shoot each other repeatedly at close range and keep fighting as though this were a superhero-type action flick. They lost me after about 15 mn of story when that kind of nonsense started, in Osaka. I did enjoy some brilliant John Woo-like choreography (the overhead sequence shot most of all), but nonsense like that really spoiled the fun for me (and for the Paris audience who giggled when Wick keeps falling down the Montmartre stairs - there's no way this could happen in real life).<br><br>This is a classic case of sequilitis really, with bigger, louder and absurder as the guiding principles. Give me the same film with fewer set pieces and shorter by an hour and I would be much more satisfied. Oh, and without the teflon-coated, IRON MAN-esque suits please.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">It had a decent story for john wick with lots of action. It seemed like it tried to combine all the action of the first 3 into this movie. Some interesting characters- the blind ninja fighter and the wannabe bad guy, it was good to see Clancy Brown in this movie. Some fight scenes were really good. Some may have went too long yet Decent overall. The music and background music wasnt as good as the first 3- some of the fight music sounded like it was taken right from The other john wicks. They Definitely gave it a more of a New York feel with the classic new york movie they paid homage to in this movie.</div>

It had everything that you would expect from this movie. The fight scenes, gun scenes, choreography, music.... great soundtrack!! All were perfectly chosen. There were a few scenes where I felt the music could have been much louder. It was an odd choice and I'll crank it way up at home. They brought in some new characters ... likeable characters. I could see a spin-off with nobody. Something else with a couple others that had some loose ends that were not neatly completed.<br><br>John wick 4 really tied things together well and had a great moral to the story. It showed that our actions have consequences. Watch it on the big screen and enjoy some time with sn old friend.</div>

Characters are great especially Donnie Yen's Caine, he stole the whole fu$$ing movie - his acting and fight scenes are just masterpiece, this is Donnie's best Hollywood movie yet. Scott Adkins' Killa was also amazing, even in fatsuit he was fighting like a with out it and his fighting style reminded me of the legendary Sammo Hung in SPL: Killzone (2005), Bill Skarsgard played propably the best villian of all JW films. Action Sequences were insane, amazing, epic, incredible, jaw-dropping.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I expected a better film. First of all, I think the fighting scenes and the handling of weapons are very good, as I was used to from the other parts. Also, the scenery is very good and vivid. I also find it good that many of the characters appear again. However, I also have some criticism, so most of the fight scenes are too exaggerated and one-sided. Without exception, all shots at john wick go nowhere and thus the scenes were always very boring. But I also have to complain about the story, because some things do not really make sense and some actions do not sign the actual intentions of the characters. It's a shame that this film series finds such an end.</div>

Adding Donnie yen to the cast was a nice touch and him playing a blind man was incredible now that is something different his martial arts skills was incredible. The actor bill don't ask me to spell his second name because that is a mouthful lol but he did do an incredible job for the action probably the best action you will likely see in an action movie again incredible keanu reeves did an amazing job that's what got me liking keanu reeves after seeing the first chapter the scene at the end was different and in my opinion spoiled it a little bit.</div>

If you like action, and liked the first three movies especially for the action; you're in for a hell of a ride with this one. The action is superb, with shots and angles and stunts you have never seen before.<br><br>That's about it, yeaah<br><br>Lets talk negatives then;
Keanu reeves, as sympathetic as he might be in person, deserves a golden raspberry for this performance. His dialogue fits onto less than one sheet of paper (in a 3 hour movie!!) from which half is just an overly dramatic &gt;&gt;yeaah&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;maybe&lt;&lt; which the other guests found to be funny while I found it odd, even ridiculous as it went on. His performance completely pulled me out of the immersion. Very unsatisfying.<br><br>The protagonist John Wick does literally nothing in this movie that regains our sympathy for him.<br><br>They just throw him in there and say &gt;&gt;that's the protagonist, go root for him&lt;&lt;, but I just had a hard time swallowing that pill which lead to me not having fun on his journey to get away from the table<br><br>On a different note,
I already mentioned the inflated runtime of 170 minutes. This is at least 40 minutes too long! They could have completely get rid of Shamier Anderson's character and nothing would have changed about the outcome of the movie, which wasn't particularly bad but also not shocking, as it was rather poorly foreshadowed.<br><br>All in all, the action in this is world class, perhaps the best action in a movie ever, but as soon as the action was over, the fun was over as well.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Prior to watching this film I committed one of the ultimate film watching sins of glancing over some of the reviews before having seen the film myself. I saw a lot of the more negative reviews saying this film felt more Bond esc than John Wick, going into the film I didn't understand what they meant but now I completely get it. John Wick first premiered in theatres 9 years ago and was a small hearty revenge tale action film that over time picked up a large audience of fans (me included). Much like any film that picks up a fan base it gets a sequel and now we're 4 films deep and going back to the whole bond thing this feels like the 4th film in an action film franchise and by that I mean everything is bigger, bigger and more stars, bigger and longer action set pieces and a bigger and more complex plot. Bigger however doesn't always mean better it's about what you do with it and what these films have done is turned into a franchise in every sense of the word. Lost is that small revenge thriller feel of the first film and now we have over the top villains like Bill Skarsgard who comes across as less menacing and more spoilt brat. We also have a protagonist that feels invincible at points laughably so, for instance John jumps out of a third floor window at one point lands on his back on top of a van and almost instantly gets up and walks off. There were a few of these 'yeah right' moments and they really took me out of the film temporarily. That being said however the film is far from a total lost, Donnie Yen is by far the stand out addition to the franchise, he steals every scene he's in and I definitely have a craving to go and watch more of his earlier work now. The action sequences despite being over the top at points are as slick and well choreographed as they were in the previous films and almost feel like a dance just a bloody and brutal one. The ending is also really solid and something we haven't seen before in a John Wick film, the film definitely leaves you on a high note.<br><br>I definitely enjoyed this film but compared to the other John Wick films it's down there with three as one of the weaker entries in the franchise for me.<br><br>I hope they stick with four films and that it doesn't get anymore over the top as after all
Nobody does it better than Bond.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">First of let's just get this out of the way, the action is great in this movie. It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.<br><br>Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.<br><br>Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all. I truly hope this was studio pressure, and that Stahelski releases a director's cut to remedy this. I can only assume there's dialog and complex choreography that were cut in lieu of the popcorn stuff.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">John Wick is not my cup of tea. I never saw the first 2 of the series, but I did see the 3rd one when it came out few years ago. Still, I'm not too familiar with the story nor do I have an emotional investment in what this is. Seeing John Wick 4, I want to see it again. It's a bit long, which is my only complaint. 30 minutes shorter and I would've given this a 9 out of 10. I also don't connect as much with John as well as I did with every other character. I was rooting for Donnie Yen more than John. Even with heavy plot armour and dodging more bullets than any action star in history, Reaves gives Wick a strong action presence. It's comedic how unrealistic he surmounts so much and yet it's kick ass.<br><br>The main thing is how well shot this movie is. The cinematography is top notch. Some of the imagery is beautiful. Most importantly, the action is filmed without shaky cam or too many close-ups. You can see everything without getting disoriented. It's terrific. My favourite part of the movie was the first act at Asoka's hotel. The build-up and fight sequence there is one of the most memorable set pieces I've ever witnessed in an action movie. What I liked is how most of the action is physical combat, which I think was the same in the previous instalments. However, the entire fight at the hotel was so good. The emotion between the father and daughter really stood out to me. There could be a whole other movie about the daughter. The kung fu sword fighting is something I want to see more of.<br><br>Finally, we have the the standoff at the end. It is beautiful and surprisingly unpredictable how it plays out. John Wick 4 is my favourite action movie in years and will be remembered as one of the best closing movies in a franchise ever, if it is the final one.</div>

I'll keep this spoiler free but in closing the movie was nearly 3 hours and it could have been 105 minutes. To sum up where this movie went wrong, just watch the episode of the office where Micheal explains the downfall of the Diehard series. Also the plot and character motivations make absolutely no sense. It's only 5/10 because choreography was really well done. You believe he knows how to actually shoot but at the end of the day John Wick is supposed to be human, not a mix of wolverine, Hawkeye, and have a suit that doubles as captain America's shield. This movie is ruined like a video game can be ruined by god mode.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The movie is worth the wait. This movie franchise has set the bar really high for action movies and it is going to be a benchmark of sorts for the action movies of future. Keanu Reeves is amazing, as he has been in the first 3 installments. Donnie Yen is treat to watch and his action sequences are just mind blowing. The run time is a bit on the higher side but you will not feel that. The action seems a bit over the top at certain times but it does not last long. This movie franchise is making audience fall in love with close combat action and its good. Watch it in a good theater with proper sound and screen. The experience will be enhanced.</div>

By far the most Best in JW franchise I've seen. This deserves to get all the Oscar's how good it is. The direction,the action, Cinematic all are top notched. Nothing less expected. I had great high hopes for this movie and im not disappointed .Loved this movie, I'd recommend everyone to watch JW1,2,3 then watching the 4th film will give you the best experience.<br><br>Best movie by far this year , this gonna be HUGE HIT.<br><br>Happy watching.<br><br>You get only peace when you die.<br><br>Adiós John Wick.<br><br>Great story,

Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain't a "chapter." It's a whole damn book - a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium of all manners of asskickery.<br><br>Full review at ScreenCrush. (And after you see the movie, here's my interview with Chad Stahelski that's JUST about the stairwell scene that I am sure will go down in history as one of the all-time great moments in action cinema.) Everyone is trying to rip off the way John Wick movies do action but I wish they would also try to rip off the way John Wick movies are really pretty and lit extremely well.</div>

He gets hit by 4 cars full speed, all 1000 enemies have worse aim than stormtroopers they are basically in a single file line waiting their turn to attack him instead of all at once
he never reloads his guns when he should clearly be out of ammo several times. I leaned over to my dad in one scene and said let me guess when him and that guy with the dog meet to where they can both shoot each other both of their guns are going to click and not shoot and then they are going to get into a fist fight 30 seconds later exactly what I said happened the whole movie is the most generic thing I've ever seen. The only good things I can say about this movie are the set designs and scenery all of it's beautifully filmed. Oh "YEAH" and he also falls from tall buildings several times and doesn't seem phased at all after hitting poles on the way down.</div>

I went with a group of 5 of all ages - 16 to 53. Everyone admitted they dozed off a few times - granted it was a 7:30 show and we got out at 10:30pm. Great actors, and a few new ones that added to the story. I won't spoil it, the one has a major disability that would make it impossible to pull off what he does in the movie. But... this is John Wick, Hollywood, special effects, and we all know John Wick, his Kevlar suit, unlimited ammo and moves... well, who can stop him? 😃 if your a fan, go! If you have not watched the others, watch them first.</div>

The movie had a runtime of 169 minutes and I just did not want it to end at all, although you think that you know what might happen next but it always kind of surprises you.<br><br>The fighting scenes and the coreography is just a pure joy to watch, such a talented cast, even the guys who were 'taking a beating' .<br><br>It nicely continues the story from where chapter 3 left off and ends with somewhat of an open ending in my opinion, adding new interesting characters, each unique to their own. Just marvelous!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The ending left me feeling frustrated, empty and just unfulfilled. I feel like I sat through a 3 hour movie... and now 3 previous movies... for nothing. We demand a rewrite. The ending was almost as bad as the last matrix movie. Everything else was fine as far as the storyline goes. How did you think people were going to feel about this/ or react. Like oh my gosh what a wonderful ending.... Now when everyone asks me how the movie was, all I can say is eh, it made me feel worthless at the end. Don't go see it in theater is what I'll say lol Hope it does well after all the bad reviews come out after opening.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">After seeing Chapter 4 for the fist time while just vaguely remembering plot of each previous movie I watched just once at the time they came out I didn't know what to think about it. Action, cinematography, stunt work and characters were all great, but I just didn't get the movie.<br><br>So I decided watch every John Wick back to back and see Chapter 4 again. And I must say, those movies really are one story told in four chapters (so far). They continue where previous left and build on each other really nicely.<br><br>And Chapter 4 is the biggest, boldest and the most beautiful of them all. I get the movie now and I think that it's brilliant, especially the final part. There is one location that feels bit weaker than the others, but I won't be lowering the score for that.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This movie is not a masterpiece. It's fun cinema and skilled action choreography, yes it is.<br><br>BUT not a masterpiece.<br><br>For it to be that, it would need to:
1. Have a runtime of 2hrs (Not the bloated, self indulgent 3hrs that is)
EDIT more!<br><br>2. Less of John Wick falling from buildings, diving out of windows and especially falling down the STAIRS!...just LESS of all that!...its like he has Fast n Furious or Xmen or super soldier powers...or did he sell his soul to the devil? Death walks, sure i get....but it's just too much sometimes and it becomes corny, less dangerous or no consequences.<br><br>That ridiculous Stairs scene became like a Mel Brooks movie to me
(a joke, the wrong tone)
3. It needs Better writing.. with at least a dozen quotable quotes, that stay with you (like Aliens or Die Hard has n does)...
Can anyone think of any awesome quotes besides his "Yeahhh"? I cant.<br><br>4. Also, Donny Yen should not of been blind, it was too unbelievable all the time, He was an equal to Daredevil? No, he didnt have superpowers sonar radar.....However, his character was cool and i enjoyed him, but i would of enjoyed him even more if he could see. He could of been a cocky but most skilled ninja without being blind.<br><br>LOL, i kept expecting him to say "The Fowce" ;)<br><br>Also it would benefit to occasionally be little bit more raw and dusty, less polished and Slick ALL THE TIME (the first Chapter was like that ;)<br><br>for me 6.7/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">The John Wick franchise has never let me down.<br><br>The first John Wick film stands out because at that time, no one had ever seen an American action movie pull off some of the sequences that it did. It had a clear and simple story about revenge. You hurt someone and something I loved and now I'm coming after you. The first film is flawless.<br><br>The second film took what we already knew of John Wick and what he is capable of and raised the bar a little.<br><br>Even though people can't stand Chapter 3, I always thought it did a pretty awesome job in expending on the lore and world surrounding this character. It had phenomenal action sequences and visually, it was beautiful.<br><br>In my honest opinion, JW4 is the best entry of this entire franchise. Yes, even better than the original. This film has a near 3 hour run time that never feels like it and that entire time is filled with non-stop action. I find it incredible how these films could continue to pump out jaw-dropping moments four movies in but, yup, they definitely did it here. It's also got a lot of heart. For a movie that absolutely needs no expansion of story to please it's core audience, this movie still had it. The new characters that are introduced are awesome as well. Donnie Yen's Caine is probably my favorite character in all of the films.<br><br>This movie has the best action, the best cinematography and the highest stakes of all four movies.<br><br>If you haven't seen it yet, please do.<br><br>It's action movie perfection.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">While I don't generally rate more recent films higher as they haven't stood the test of time yet John Wick Chapter 4 is an exception. It has a far better story than parts 2 and 3 due to John having a more personal motivation for his typical antics. Chapter 4 also benefits from the best action sequences of the series, In parts 1, 2 and 3 there have to me only been one or two standout action scenes; the club fight in the first the entire Italy concert/catacombs sequence in the second and the Continental hotel siege in the third. John Wick 4 on the other hand has huge fight in a hotel in Osaka, a nightclub showdown blowing the one from the first out of the water and finally the final part of the film is literally non stop action around Paris In which there's a car chase around the arc de triomphe which quickly turns into a fight in which John throws people into the oncoming traffic, a Hotline Miami style top down shootout with and finally a long fight up a tall staircase. The fourth chapter of the franchise also has the best supporting cast since the original including a brilliant Donnie Yen and the series best villain in Bill Skarsgard. Overall a near perfect all out action film.<br><br>Final Rating 9.0/10<br><br>Also make sure to stay until the very end because of there is an important post credit scene.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">When the first John Wick movie came out, it revitalized the action movie genre. Nearly 10 years later, and two sequels in, we get arguably the best installment of the franchise. John Wick: Chapter 4 ups the ante on absolutely everything. From stunning set pieces, to non-stop high voltage action sequences.<br><br>Keanu Reeves once again is breathtaking in the role of the legendary hitman. He is a true inspiration, proving that age is just a number. The guy is in his 50's and is pulling off amazing choreographed action sequences. The action sequences are incredible. Utilizing the setting around them, from Morocco to Japan to France and all the way back to New York, which subsequently makes every scene unique and a stand out. Nothing feels out of place or boring, each scene has prominence and substance to them.<br><br>John Wicks war against The High Table brings him into conflict with some interesting new adversaries. Bill Skarsgards villainous role as one of the heads of The High Table is menacing, cold and calculating. He pulls the strings of the plot all the way to the end. Donnie Yen yet again plays another blind badass character. This time a hitman who has a history Wick, and a motive that forces him into hunting Wick down. A very cool and compelling character that I hope to see more of later on.<br><br>The two hour and forty minute runtime went by like a breeze, captivating from the very beginning to the somber bittersweet ending. A satisfying conclusion to John Wicks story, as he was finally at peace with everything and returned home to his wife. I hope his story stays concluded, even though nowadays it seems like no one truly stays dead.<br><br>In light of the conclusion I can honestly conclude that John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the greatest action movies of all time. Subsequently, the franchise will go down in history as one of the greats, as the bar for action movies reaches a new standard.</div>

Admittedly not the biggest action fan but this is undoubtedly has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, the part around the Arc de triomphe especially had me smiling and gasping.<br><br>Obviously the whole thing is over the top and far fetched and it's a tough knowing how far to push it with giving the viewers what they want but not be such BS that it's off putting. Well unfortunately with this Caine character I just couldn't get into it, for a blind guy to be doing what he was doing throughout the movie in what was very much a main role was just too ridiculous and ruined the whole movie for me. I can see why it's getting the plaudits it is from fans, but reminded me of that one episode of that 'See' that I watched before I shouted BS and switched it off.</div>

No, it's not a joke, it is the wildest action movie of this century.<br><br>Of course, one can not ignore its thoughtful take on the nature of power, order, and the power of will, but... We would not be honest if we denied the fact that, over all things, this saga is sheer entertainment, powerful visuals of martial arts and gun fu, bigger than life destruction, a non stop pace, and a really thrilling concept of spectacle based on the point of "more is more". For if this alone wouldn't be enough, we have stunning suspense and the feel of enormous authority and strength of the French Marquis, and also the deeply emotional and satisfactory dramatic work of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen.<br><br>What else can I say? Simply WOW, since I have felt definitely blown away by the bird-eye shot in the building with infinite grenade shooting. But... what is infinite? If you are wondering about it, I only have to say: stairs, lots of stairs.<br><br>The final duel at the sunrise is just deeply satisfying and leaves me thinking we need another fight with Keanu. Let's hope for this to be only a temporal game over, and maybe we can see Mr. Wick down those stairs triumphant.<br><br>I won't stop him until I see him in Turkey fighting Kenan Imirzalioglu.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick Chapter 4 offers stunning visuals and action-packed fight scenes, but ultimately falls short in terms of storytelling. The movie takes us on a thrilling journey through Japan and Paris, showcasing their unique beauty and culture. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed, and Keanu Reeves' performance as John Wick continues to impress.<br><br>However, the movie lacks depth and fails to inspire beyond its aesthetic appeal. The plot feels predictable and fails to introduce any new ideas or themes. While the action is impressive, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the movie progresses.<br><br>Overall, John Wick Chapter 4 is a visually stunning movie that delivers in terms of action, but lacks the substance to truly captivate and inspire its audience. If you're a fan of the franchise or looking for an entertaining action movie, this movie won't disappoint. However, if you're looking for a movie that will leave a lasting impression, John Wick Chapter 4 falls short.</div>

You officially topped all my action star list and some more. The easter eggs and The Warriors flashback was genius. I do hope you get the recognition that is well deserved with all the hard work you put into these movies! You will always be praised for your talents and your humility Keanu. We need more of you in the world. Regardless I don't think we have seen the end of the talent and dedication this man has. The top view scene was off the hook!! Amazing! Skip the Matrix stuff, the writers don't know what they are doing anymore. Much love my man! RIP Lance you will be missed!</div>

If you like a crazy story, which is emotional and pulls you in, then this is the movie for you.<br><br>If this is the end for John Wick then it was a fitting way to go out. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.<br><br>Sometimes a movie with non stop action will get old and boring very quick, but the constant scene changing keeps it fresh. I love that Wick takes no prisoners, everyone dies.<br><br>I just hope there will be a chapter 5, these movies are some of the best action going around.</div>

Awesome kills from John and other characters throughout. Great villains throughout the movie very well written too. The cinematography was great. The pacing was fantastic it managed to keep me engaged throughout the whole film with all of the action in between. The whole movie was very well written and you can tell they really tried to make this the best John wick movie and pulled out all of the stops.<br><br>I believe this was a great way to end the John Wick Franchise. May you Rest in Peace John Wick and more importantly Lance Reddick who was taken from us too soon.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">To start, I feel like I should explain why I rated this movie so highly.<br><br>It's because I was laughing hysterically through half of the 2.5 hour long movie.<br><br>At no point in this movie did I feel like I was watching a traditional or even new age action thriller. It felt like a parody of John Wick movies. Granted it would have been a good parody if the movie were limited to a standard 1 hour 20 minute runtime, but it felt artificially prolonged.<br><br>It's a weak and tragic ending to the John Wick series. It's violence becomes inconsequential after a solid and insufferable 25 minute segment near the beginning. It's quirky avant garde settings are so absurd that it destroys any serious emotional moments that the plot tries to push on the audience.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Chapter 4 is by far, far the best in the series and the best action movie we've gotten since the matrix in 1999.<br><br>The film is a story about freedom for john but poses a interesting question about what john will do if he wins and gets his freedom. Everyone gets a motivation that's understandable and leads them to clash with others often in a fight between them.<br><br>Chad stahelski has improved hugely as a director its no longer just cool stunts but now he's really matured as a director he plays to his strengths and the directing is by far one of the best aspects of the movie<br><br>The film looks amazing not just the colors but the action pursues onscreen is just jawdropping with people performing these stunts live in front of you and you feel every punch hit kick stab and that's truly a credit to the stunt performers here and the vfx team that helped bring it all together. Now the film is 169 minutes long. However I didn't feel the 3 hours and instead it felt like 1 hour and 40 minutes which is a magical feet of editing and pacing.<br><br>The films side charachters have their own storylin eand events. The most memorable is caine played by donnie yen a blind assassin and a old friend of John whose sent by Bill Skargards marquee the highest ranked of the high table to kill john wick and seeing how john has nothing to lose you actually feel sorry for caine as its clear he doesn't want to do what he's been tasked with doing but is aware of what happens if rules are broken and it makes him a very interesting charachter that I would love to have a spin off film with. Other memorable side characters are mr nobody or tracker as he's listed here on imdb (shaming anderson) is a low class assassin whose after john however is on and off between going ahead with what he's set out to do for personal reasons and then we have shimazy (hiroyuki sanada) whose a owner of a continental in Japan and gets a set piece to shine as well as his daughter AKira (Rina sawayama) who blames john for breaking the rules and fears for her fathers safety.<br><br>The bowery king (Lawrence fishbourne), winston (Ian mc shane) and charon (lance reddick r.i.p) are all here and have their own reasons for helping john tldr every charachter here is excellent and brought to life in such a way that you forget that they're not real people and just actors playing them this also goes for keanu reeves as john wick he's brilliant here and we all know that he does his own stunts which is really the draw for these movies but this one is amazing in all departments. He'll even the soundtrack is amazing here tyler bates and Joel j Richards score is present in the film and benefits the action on screen and over all film.<br><br>The film also gives john a satisfying resolution to his story over the 4 movies.<br><br>The only other action movies I'd put above this is die hard and terminator 2 judgement day to even be compared to those movies should scream see this movie if it doesint I don't know what will.<br><br>See this in cinemas ideally a imax cinema and don't wait till its on a streaming service this was made to be seen on the biggest screen possible.<br><br>So overall, It's a 10/10 movie that you should absolutely see in cinemas if at all possible you won't regret it and is by far the best action film since the matrix in 1999. SEE IT!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">John Wick 4 is a very good movie, the action is there, especially after so many CGI blockbusters, I didnt feel that since Top Gun Maverick, its so good to see real people doing stuff, and jumping and fighting, and not CGI monsters. The locations are pretty good, I guess sometimes we could notice some green screen, like in one portion of the movie where theres cars in a circle.. and at the end, it would be more cool if it were filmed in a real location with real lightning. But the movie us very cool, when its not showing new characters that dont develop too much, or they want you to care about them more than you really care.<br><br>When it comes to writing and dialogs I feel that this movie is very, very generic, my favorite is 3 cuz its just an action movie with enough dialog and lots of shooting, this one has more talking than action and i felt bored a lot, cuz everything is a cliche, Keanu barely has lines, and thats the bad part of the movie, all the talking. But I understand thats cuz this one is a goodbye from Wick,or maybe not.<br><br>Another thing that bothered me was the Kevlar suit, that everyone has, even the assassins that are not wearing a suit have kevlar clothes, that really bothered me, sometimes I could notice people getting shoot at the head ( bald guys ) and the bullet just ricocheting, thats was weird.. I feel that in this movie Keanu is superman, nothing touches him, he can fall from 4-5 floors and nothing happens, and in the previous movies Wick was not superman, he didnt have powers or anything like that, thats a bad thing too, cuz I didnt feel the stakes.<br><br>I didnt like the blind man, a blind man is a insane killer in a world with snipers? Yeah right.. but thats it.<br><br>The best action part for me was the dragon breath and nightclub.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">All the john wick films are incredible, but none are as good as this one. From the action that is so iconic to this franchise, to the incredible music score, and of course the incredible characters.<br><br>The action in this film is insane. I don't think we have seen any film as action packed as this one. Clocking in at 2hr54min this movie is very long. And you kind of feel that while watching. But the way they plant 10 minute long fight scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.<br><br>The music in this movie is a game changer for this movie. Because of the music the action scenes and other scenes as well are on another level. The cyberpunk esc beats is fantastic. Love the credit song.<br><br>This movie is a must see and definitely rounds the franchise off fantastically.</div>

It showcases the best of Wick's humanity.

Without rules we're animals
All distilled down<br><br>-no spoilers-<br><br>Classic John Wick in the masterpiece Awesomesphere!<br><br>#4 is the bestest of the series in all areas.<br><br>Neon lights, glass and mirror combat fights, mano a mano fights, bow and arrow, car chases, and some puppy love.<br><br>Punchy and Clever and a touch of wicked humor.<br><br>Nothing was left out in this promises made and promises kept sequel.<br><br>For sure, one can enjoy this without seeing the first 3, bc the mystique and narrative are just right. The rhythm and rhyme is impeccable. It's so simple and clear in its own pretenses that unless you understand the genre you just won't get it. As smart and zany as the original TV Batman and
the original Star Trek.<br><br>Pummel perfection.<br><br>Tokyo, New York City, Berlin, Sahara Desert, Paris...candle lit sunlit, neon lights...the cinematography is brilliant. And the stunt work is pure brilliancy and exhilarating.<br><br>The layered sublime tints of orange sherbet, blurple, and pistachio green hues splattered subtly on faces, shiny black vinyl shadows, stainless steel,
is astounding.<br><br>Skittles meets lava lights meets noire.<br><br>An impressive concert of staging, breath taking moods and vistas.<br><br>Setting is lush, costumes are tailored, both essential in defining attitude and depth and logic to a warriors demeanor.<br><br>Everything including chaos has its place and purpose and is unapologetically perfect how it lands. Heads or tails. Death or life.<br><br>All your past characters are here with some new faces that are sleek and streamline. Brooding, calculating, and committed.<br><br>For those who are seeing this with no backstory, you won't feel disappointed or out of the loop. The film is excellent exciting and action is everything.<br><br>Keanu Reeves is enjoyable as well as the cast.<br><br>I will say the opening scenes were shocking.<br><br>Dont miss, there is another scene after all the closing credits.<br><br>The best part of this film is they took time to give a cut that tells and fleshes out an appealing story. It's fun and easy to watch. So go and enjoy.</div>

Nothing was really going on and the plot development wasn't there.<br><br>Now, it's fun to go escape for nearly 3 hours, but I highly doubt this is going to hold up with repeat viewings. And like I said, the other 3 were far more superior than this, since there seemed to be an actual plot.<br><br>Now the pros. The cinematography was top notch, and Connie Yen stole the show and this movie will make him into a mega star. His character, (a blind assassin) is so much fun, I can see them doing a spin off on him and it could work if done right.<br><br>But this movie could have cut about 30 to 45 minutes. And there were some scenes, like John Wick falling off unbelievable heights and getting up unscathed that took me out. There is just no way that is possible and really took me out of suspending my belief. The movie was cartoonish at times and I felt I was watching Loony Toons with some of the stunts.<br><br>So, basically, the movie is a fun popcorn flick, but because it has no whit, no humor and can get tedious from time to time, I can only give it 6 stars. Next time, put some things in there to stimulate our brains.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Best Action Scenes in the past years and one of the most impresive choreography and storyline is predictive but surprises at some point. Franchise have been built bigger and Characters in the movie are very good. A new approach has been done by director by giving this movie a new perspective and Cinematography is better than all the previous movies, VFX work is very good but can be easily noticed in some scenes. Movie does not feel like stretched and Comedy is added in this part which i liked, All Credit goes to stuntman, Director and New Music is very great. Background Score is also very good.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Sometimes when you have high expectations for a movie, probably you could be disappointed. However this new chapter on the John Wick saga takes you into a new dimension of action. Some of these action sequences are very original, you can note a hard work to make a difference respect other action movies. The electronic soundtrack is an excellent complement for the action. I recommend to see the movie in a IMAX cinema, this way you'll experience all the action details and the amazing sound. I usually see movies on IMAX and I call tell you the John Wick sound is absolutely amazing respect others movie in the same format.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">...or is it?<br><br>The wife and I went home after watching this on opening night and immediately queued up the first John Wick that kicked everything off. I remarked after the scene when his puppy is killed in that first film "and this is what started a nonstop body count that ended up somewhere over 1,000 and spanned four films!!" I think this supplanted the Bond franchise in terms of being more in touch with the kind of 21st century post-Tarantino violence film goers have come to expect from our favorite assassin with a very big chip on his shoulder.<br><br>Such a shame to have lost Lance Reddick. Just glad we got to see him on the screen one final time. He and Ian McShane embodied The Continental and brought it to life.<br><br>We never once grew bored or weary during the nearly 3-hour runtime. As with each prior film, the action only grew more frenetic and continued unabated from the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard has obviously cornered the market playing creepy baddies, and his Marquis was wonderfully understated yet menacing. Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown (THE KERGAN!), and Donnie Yen all delivered in their respective roles as erstwhile allies or opponents. We can only hope that there is still more to John Wick and his story!</div>

However, after a 20 minute YouTube recap of all 3 I felt I was good to go. Although rather unnecessary as the movie is pretty easy to follow. So don't think it's important to have seen the others.<br><br>I'll keep this simple:<br><br>If you want to see 3 hours of well choreographed non-stop violence with some questionable decisions from the surrounding members of the public and some unfathomable bone break escapes from Mr Wick. Then this movie is for you.<br><br>Went to see it in a packed IMAX and so many people around me were visibly bored and audibly exasperated with the movie.<br><br>The one saving grace was a hilarious slapstick stairs moment towards the end which had the whole cinema laughing out loud.<br><br>I did enjoy the warriors homage too.<br><br>In a nutshell, if you want an excuse to eat a large popcorn then you'll have 3 action packed but long hours to get to the hard kernels at the bottom.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I would like to start with a story about scorpion and sage: A wise and peaceful sage sees a scorpion drowning in the river and decides to rescue it. He lifts the scorpion out of the water, but the scorpion stings him and he drops it back. The sage tries again, but the scorpion stings him once more. The sage does not give up and attempts to save the scorpion for the third time, but he gets stung again. He asks the scorpion why it keeps hurting him when he is trying to help. The scorpion replied, "I cannot help it. It is my nature to sting."<br><br>The moral of the story is that some creatures cannot change their nature and it is important to accept this fact and act accordingly.<br><br>This story applies to John Wick, a hitman who cannot escape his identity as an assassin. One character from the movie tells John that he is an assassin, and despite his efforts to get out of the business, he can't deny who he is. Even though John tries to avoid violence, he keeps getting pulled into it, and it's inevitable that he will continue to be a killer.<br><br>The movie is a classic genre movie: action. The action genre in movies is a type of film that typically features fast-paced and thrilling physical stunts, fights, and chases. In the end, you do not feel cheated.<br><br>One of the dialogues: "The bloodshed wasn't necessary. But the bloodshed was the point." It seems like the characters do not seek to achieve any goal or outcome by shedding blood, but rather they enjoy the act itself as an end in itself. They only care about satisfying their bloodlust and proving their dominance.<br><br>We often think that action is the best way to solve our problems and achieve our goals. But is that always true? What if our actions have negative consequences or go against our moral values? These questions challenge us to think more deeply about what it means to act and how our actions affect ourselves and others.<br><br>The movie has amazing and beautiful action scenes. The stunts are awesome, and, again, the gunfights look more like dance moves. Wick is always so smooth and clever when he fights.<br><br>The abundance of locations and vivid colors present a visual treat that is unmatched. The vivid imagery sets the perfect tone, both for the action and the dialogue. This movie offers an exceptional sensory journey, a rare treat not often found in action films. Every frame is dripping with texture and layers. There are so many things happening in the foreground and background, and yet you are never confused about what you have to focus on.<br><br>The story of John Wick, brought to life by the masterful acting of Keanu Reeves, is a tale of human suffering and redemption. Wick, once a man of simple desires, finds himself thrust into a world of violence and revenge, driven by his past traumas and the desire for retribution.<br><br>Reeves understands the depth of his character's suffering and portrays Wick not as a mere killing machine, but as a man with a soul that has been wounded by loss and grief. Despite the constant physical punishment he endures, Wick never loses sight of his humanity, and his pain only serves to reinforce his determination.<br><br>Through Wick's struggles, we see the timeless truth that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience.<br><br>One of the key tenets of stoicism is the idea that we should be indifferent to external circumstances. This does not mean that we should be unfeeling, but rather that we should strive to maintain a sense of inner calm. John Wick embodies this idea in many ways. Despite the numerous threats he faces, he remains calm and focused.<br><br>Another important principle is the idea that we should focus on what we can control, rather than worrying about what we cannot. John Wick exemplifies this idea in his single-minded pursuit of his goals. When someone threatens him, he does not waste time on fruitless worry or despair. Instead, he takes action to protect himself and those around him, using his skills and experience.<br><br>In short, John Wick is not just a deadly assassin, but also a stoic philosopher. Through his actions and demeanor, he embodies many of the key principles of stoicism.<br><br>John Wick 4 is action cinema turned into high art by creators who believe that every single one of the countless kills in this movie still has to look cool as hell. Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers exactly what you want from a John Wick film.</div>

I would also argue that this is the most visually stunning of all the movies. Hardly any single minute is wasted multiple great build ups and payoffs throughout the movie. If you've already been a fan of the first 3 movies, I cannot recommend seeing this one enough. And for any newcomers: I just cannot emphasize how superb the JW franchise is as a whole.<br><br>The epic fighting sequences are so well done that it felt like watching a well choreographed fighting ballet.<br><br>It is indeed the best action Movie i have ever seen! Period.</div>

If you've seen any of the the first three John Wick movies, you know they are action filled.....But get ready for a new standard in packing action into a movie. New guns, new twists, so much excitement. It is a long movie, but if you like tons of fighting and action it keeps you wanting more. It's definitely a popcorn flick, but so good and entertaining. Unlike the last three Wick movies, Chapter 4 had the audience laughing out loud at several scenes. Without being a spoiler, I'll just say there are a few really funny things that happen. We absolutely loved it and can't wait for Chapter 5. Keanu is great!!</div>

Joh wick have a great action thriller and the most important is you can see the camera angles the way it's directed the scene were really amazing. You will think what will be next and will be surprised when the people of the high table starts attacking John Wick. Also it has shown in the start about the women empowerment and the message that friendship is everything always maintain. And the women are more stronger than what we think.</div>

The cast, the dialogue (or the lack of it!), the action scenes and various backdrops that really set the scene for the conclusion of this blockbuster. I literally reached nirvana when I saw Keanu pull out his gun for the 600th time to shoot the bad guys. I can't recommend it enough! It certainly is the best action film I've ever seen, and I've seen many, as I don't have other hobbies or interests in my life. Don't call me a loser, I rather you refer to me as a fan. It's a no brainer movie guys and you know what ? I like it a lot, thinking about the tattoo now.....</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I was really looking forward to this final installment of the the Keanu Reeves titular character as I loved the previous 3 in the series and up until the film went rip-off the rails I was suspending the superhuman resilience of Johnny Wick himself. But when they brought in a dj towards the latter part of the film the film lost my support. The reason for this is that it is a direct rip-off of the Warriors, one of my favorite films. From the dialogue to the use of Nowhere to Run, it was the director's insert that, excuse the expression, proverbially killed the movie for me. I read after seeing the movie that the director wanted to homage the film but this extraneous garbage was so cringe for me. Maybe a lot of people who never saw the Warriors won't care, but for me, it displayed a useless insert. It was almost word for word plagiarism. It took me out of the film until the final scene when I was sort of able to finish the film with some assemblage of enjoyment. Sad how certain things can ruin a good thing. Oh, and the tag after the credits was so predictable, especially since word got out that certain surviving characters were spinning off into their own films, etc. If that dj scene weren't in the film, I'd be giving it a higher rating.</div>

I don't want to go in detail because of spoilers but I'll try the best I can one of the main characters at the beginning a character that we all love found his fate can't help but making you awwww. The culture of one the friends of wick is pretty cool. Parts of Germany, France, and New York great scenes and the fights. Spoiler alert there a lot of gun shots. Lol the bad guy kinda of annoying and such a cliche. But guess kinda work. My only issue was the annoying black dj girl trying so hard to sound cool. Sorry. But the warriors made it cool this was just a wannabe. And the end it was so cool wait until the end of the credits.</div>

If we just talk about actors and shots is nearly perfect. BUT!!!!!! The plot is xxxx. I don't know how families is and I don't know how so call table is. And why they fight, fight for what? Power fight between families and table?(like politics fight)? I don't know, that makes no sense at all. Btw, 1,2 and 3 is fresh in action movies and make me feel new, with a almost clear outline of plot. 4 as the end is ok, a end with "who knows" but may be happy ending. But if 4 is a single movie, it's failed.</div>

I was a little concerned since the two previous ones only got crazier and crazier, trying to one up each other. But this one's story, plot, set pieces, and action is actually the best we've seen from the franchise so far. The casting was perfect, all the actors did a phenomenal job and I can't forget about Lance Reddick. It was a little sad knowing what happened to him in real life but, as always, his actual performance in the movie was amazing. I'd strongly recommend this to any fan of this series. You won't be disappointed.</div>

Is this a metaphor for the current society? Did I mention the movie is way too long we watched this in IMAX and my ears were hurting from the gun noise. The fighting scenes are pretty awesome and the scenery is nice, but I think good movie needs more than justice this. I wouldn't recommend to watch this at home and not in the theatre. You can have a break and adjust sound yourself.. I do hope there won't be a sequel for movies of the same character must be enough. Just make a video game of it.</div>

This movie is a work of art.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">After the first film ended, it was clear to me that the filmmakers had done something special. Upon the ending of the 4th installment, I can say with confidence that this is likely the best action movie ever made. I stray away from action movies due to overused tropes, abundant cgi, and weak characters. This franchise breaks the mold, and gives us well thought out characters that we CARE about. Its ideas are fresh and exciting. The cinematography here may get Oscar- nominated. The fight choreography is simply the best in the business.<br><br>Aside from Wick taking some unrealistic falls and brushing them off as only a bruise, I was wholly engrossed in # 4 for its almost 3 hour run time. If you're like me and don't bother going to the movies for action pics, do yourself a favor. Find the most extravagant screen you can, and go see this film in theaters. This is what they were made for.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Watched all 3 John Wick and was excited about the 4th installment. My apologies if my slightly low rating offends some people. I'll keep spoilers to a minimum.<br><br>The movie starts and picks up immediately from where it left off from the previous movie wasting zero time. Fast paced action like the previous installments. The visuals are good with a lot of scenes being very colorful despite most of the fight scenes takes place at night. Fight arenas where huge fights break out are visually stunning just like the previous installment.<br><br>Sound composer is superb with subtle heart rhythm in certain scenes, although not Christopher Nolan level but certainly very interesting use of sound effects.<br><br>Vast array of weapons used and some interactions conducted in the local language which is what the real world is like. You don't go to some foreign country expecting their people especially big time crime lords to speak English all the time. I also see someone took inspiration from Jackie Chan stunt technique to make some fight scene looks serious and comical at the same time.<br><br>At the end of the movie, it's a huge relief seeing the burden being lifted of John Wicks, the man himself Keanu Reeves and the moviegoers whom have been diligently following through a 4 movies.<br><br>The cons and spoilers
Character development seems to have taken back seat compared to previous movies. The movie also looks rushed as some sharp eye audiences will notice.<br><br>The plot might be linear and fast paced just like the Fast Furious series but the main difference being, if someone is watching JW4 for the first time with no background knowledge is going to be left with a lot of questions.<br><br>Wouldn't it be much more engaging if Winston was killed instead of his concierge? Then his concierge being the loyal servant works with other concierge members around the world to help JW avenge Winston's killer. First time watchers would be pleased too.<br><br>And JW this time seems to have his entire magical 3 piece suit made out of vibranium. Sustaining little injuries despite having platoons of men and women unloading obscene amounts of rounds at one man. Perhaps they all graduated from stormtrooper school.<br><br>The previous movies sees JW taking hits, seeking medical care and more character development where the audience feels more for him. David vs Goliath moment. His death scene almost looks too good, did they hire a coroner for his make up? The blood patches look too dry like its painted on. Ironman's death looks spot on as completely devastated shock, awe and peace at the same time.<br><br>Action scene in Japan seems to have the stuntman ninjas frozen in literal fear for his life. They just stood there shaking in fear waiting for JW to mercifully dispatch them. Then seem all fine and dandy taking shots from a machine gun but one throw from JW against the wall, they stand shaking in fear.<br><br>Waterfall that works in mysterious ways, haven't figured out how the waterfall club works as he fight completely drenched but walks down the stairs little water dripping off him.<br><br>It's a relief to see the man and the legend can finally closed off the original franchise for good.</div>

Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series
I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.</div>

It felt ridiculous, the fighting scenes were so badly done in that Keanu was great in them,as well he was great in the movie, but ALL opponents and people around Keanu were so badly coreographed, not only once but sooo many times the opponents were just "waiting around" until Keanu turned around and expedited them. I know this is make-believe but some semblance to reality would have been appreciated. What bad guy in real life does not attack the hero from the back until he turns around, thats when they move. All the other Wick movies surpass this one. The action int eh first and especially the second movie were soo good. These high ratings the movie is getting is unfathomable to me.</div>

This is possibly the best action movie since a long time. I can't recall the last time I went to the theater to see an action movie and oh boy was it worth my time!<br><br>My only negative point is that there's not enough action scene with Chidi (Marko Zaror who stared in Undisputed 3) and Killa (Scott Adkins from the same movie) who ate both talented in Martial Art.

Wardrobe, foley, set designers, editors, and MUAs were all the best of the best.<br><br>And yet the movie was a complete waste of time. I want it to make money for all involved, but I can't say that it was a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>The American fetishization of guns was in full force here, as was the American hyperbole: "Make it bigger, make it crazier, make it more wacky." This film had all of that, but...character development? Forget about it. A plot that made sense? No way. An emotional through line? Barely.<br><br>It's true that we care about John Wick. We became invested in him four movies ago when they killed his dog. But watching this film is like watching that dog race around the room covered in tinsel and holidays lights, barking at shadows.<br><br>How many real-world problems can be solved by shooting something in the head? Twice? How many different ways to kill do we really need depicted on a seventy-five-foot screen? How much more glorification of psychotic criminal behavior must we really witness before we ourselves become psychotic?<br><br>This movie is like porn for gun nuts or for people who feel that they can punch their way out of their problems. There's a certain comedy about this that is kind of endearing. But it's just too much. There's a recurring theme that John can't escape whom he is and so he should stop trying. Is that what we should do as well? God, I hope there's more to life than that nihilism.<br><br>The best scene in the film embraced a Sisyphean ideal that, in its absurdity, was worth viewing. And maybe that's the point. Maybe John Wick is just crazy enough to make us stop and ask, "Are we the crazy ones for viewing this? Can we ever be anything more? Should we try to find deeper meaning in our lives and relationships?" I certainly hope so.</div>

Some scene were cut and pieces of previous scene with a different angle or something... the movie felt like a parody of itself half way through... maybe it was intented that way?

                <div class="text show-more__control">JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world.</div>

Despite being the fourth movie in the franchise, it's clear that the filmmakers haven't run out of tricks, and the result is a movie that is as fresh and exciting as the first.<br><br>Keanu Reeves' portrayal of the world-weary assassin is masterful, with his weariness and struggles palpable throughout the film. The high stakes and increased death count make the character's journey even more intense, and Reeves rises to the challenge with ease.<br><br>The action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 4 are nothing short of spectacular. Each set piece is magnificently choreographed and shot, with a clear homage to classic martial-arts genres and Hollywood Westerns. The movie also manages to top everything that's come before in the franchise, with new and creative ways to keep the audience engaged.<br><br>It's also worth mentioning that the film is an absolute joy to watch in IMAX, with the immersive experience making the action sequences all the more thrilling.<br><br>While the weight of trying to top everything that's come before is not lost on the filmmakers, they rise to the challenge with elegance and creativity, delivering a movie that is both a homage to the classic action genre and a fresh addition to the franchise.<br><br>In short, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a killer night out at the movies. With an incredible performance from Keanu Reeves, stunning visuals, and non-stop action, it's a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Loved the movie. Was dying to see this and movie didn't dissapoint. Post-credit scene could lead into a spin-off, but I think that issue will be resolved in "Ballerina". John Wicks death was unexpected and I don't really think he died. Even though the movie was long, it didn't feel empty. Always something going on. Also loved the characters. Bill Skarsgård portraid his character perfectly. A little dissapointed that concierge didn't get much screen time. ( Rest in peace Lance Reddick ). Overall I say go watch the movie in your free time. 10/10 definetly go see it in ur local cinema. For sure rewatching in a month or two.</div>

The filmmakers really outdid themselves with this one, and not in a good way. I mean I'm crazy about this franchise but this one left me disappointed.<br><br>First off, there was absolutely no flow to the movie. It was like the filmmakers just threw a bunch of random scenes together and called it a day. Two of my friends actually fell asleep during the movie. I mean, who needs heart-pumping, adrenaline-fueled fights when you can have characters just standing around and talking for no reason?<br><br>And speaking of boring content, there was plenty of that in this movie. And apparently I wasn't the only one suffering, because someone in the movie theater actually soiled themselves. Yep, you read that right. John Wick 4 was so bad that it caused bodily functions to malfunction.<br><br>All in all, I would say that John Wick 4 was the worst of the franchise. But hey, at least it had some redeeming qualities, like the fact that it was over and I could leave the theater. So if you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep or make you lose control of your bowels, then John Wick 4 is the perfect choice for you.</div>
