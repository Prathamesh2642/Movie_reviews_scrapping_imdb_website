0,"By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah."
1,"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again."
2,"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close
Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved."
3,"JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023) ***1/2 Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Clancy Brown, Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Aimee Kwan, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama. Reeves' indestructible titular assassin returns in full form in the latest (and arguably best) of the fast-hitting, brutally violent action franchise with the marker on his head increased by new foe Skarsgard (oily good at being the villain) and the countdown to his demise imminent worldwide. The set pieces are displayed with cunning skill and scary accuracy with pressure point precision and unnerving balletic grace. A *chef's kiss* for the wherewithal overall and a genre fan's wet dream fulfilled. It kills! (Dir: Chad Stahelski)"
4,"May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available."
5,"Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life."
6,"We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished."
7,Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.
8,"John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it."
9,I absolutely am amazed by this film I wasn't expecting it to be that brilliant whenever the camera zooms out into the city's omg my mouth dropped the fights are like 45 to 35 mins and it's extremely brutal and the reason I'm reviewing on 23rd is cause UK released it early and I watched it at 6pm today it was absolutely amazing and brilliant the new villians was wow crazy marquis tracker Caine and many more the ending was unexpected and very sad there's no slow moments it's extremely intense and gruesome in parts so it's not for the faint of heart this film should be 18 in UK idk how it got 15 but I recommend ppl over 14+ can handle it I hope everyone enjoys this film 10/10 best film of the year if I had to rank it John wick 3 John wick 1 John wick 2 and my number 1 is John wick chapter 4 so that's my review on John wick chapter 4 I hope everyone likes the review.
10,"As Mr Wick nears the end of his journey, we are given a delight of a story well structured across its constant world building. It gives a never-ending stream of new structural and actionable aspects that feel natural as it progresses, from the action, to plot points, and personal development. An intertwining of interests rooted in common found circumstances, history, connection, as well as coincidence and luck. As he came back into this life a free man, he wills to fight to leave just as he came no matter the cost. As the nature of it expands with new and unsurprising aspects, this feature more than delivers and entertains."
11,"'Brilliant' word will be an understatement for this film .This is Chad Stahelski's finest piece of work . John wick 4 is visually stunning and at the same time is engaging .The running length is almost 3 hour but feels like 2 hr . The editing is crisp and on point . The action choreography and Set pieces are phenomenal . John Wick 4 is arguably the best action movie of this decade . The stellar star cast comprised Keanu Reeves , Doni Yen , Ian McShane , Hiroyunki Sanada,Bill Skarsgard ,Scott Adkins ,Laurence Fishburne and Late Lance Reddick etc are apt in their respective role .Kudos to the director and his team for gifting us such an amazing cinematic experience ."
12,"John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.'Chefs Kiss'"
13,"""john wick chapter 4"" whole new level of action set piecesi wouldn't say this movie is a masterpiece, but the action sequences make this one a highly worth watch in theaters. What else does anyone expect from a john wick movie. The last one hour of this movie is just like blazing fire. Keanu reeves, i dont think i can see him in any other character unless he cuts his hair or something. He just shines in the action sequences and embodies this character completely. All the extras and other actors give an amazing performance. Action sequences, top notch. Cinematography, top notch. Music, top notch."
14,Just got home from the theaters and man oh man was this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This is legitimately a MASTERPIECE. I've seen a lot of films and I think this is the best action film I've seen. Definitely the best action film saga. I had to wait in the theater for a long time because I was just so blown away by how well made this film was.The lighting has evolved with each movie and it was absolutely stunning. And that goes along with the cinematography. Just absolutely beautiful shots. And of course the choreography was incredibly well orchestrated. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE STUNTS. There seriously needs to be an Oscar for choreography and stunt work.This one is for Lance Reddick. We all love him and will miss him dearly. Bravo.
15,"And we are just luckiest people to be alive at such times. Not just best John wick movie or the one of the best action movie but a Truly Beautiful Movie (yes hundreds of people does die brutally here) but the way every scene especially the fight choregraphy is shot, its nothing short of a masterpiece. From the great actors, to the epic storyline, the comedic scenes (yes there would be many) to the extraordinary breath taking scenes, its all just perfect. The 2nd best movie i ever saw in theatres (after the endgame ofcourse). Nonethless, its a movie worth missing everything for, just go out there watch it in theatres especially in 4DX. Or you might just regret it for the rest of your lives!"
16,"Parabellum (part 3) was my favorite and as is the case in many sequels, hard to keep topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team. They keep figuring out ways to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries, each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This is one of those movies that must be watched on the big screen."
17,"So i watched the movie in IMAX. The beginning blew me away already, punch after punch my head felt like it wanted to explode in the first minute of the film, whole Theater vibrated and set the mood for the rest of the movie. The action and fight scenes are incredible. My jaw dropped almost every five minutes into the action, creative teamwork and deaths. Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me. Incredible locations and mood switches, intense moments combined with the IMAX system was just so dope. Of course there were some unrealistic moments where a normal human would have been dead already, but it is a movie, so they got to keep Mr. Wick alive somehow.Would recommend!"
18,"I can think of no other series of movies that consistently improves upon itself than the John Wick series. This fourth installment improves even upon the fantastic third movie. The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always, phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences. Make the effort to view this movie at the cinema, as you will get the full cinematic experience that this film needs to show all of the work put into it."
19,So full of ideas I am sure I need to watch it a lot more. Yeah it was great on the big screen. Like being there. Like you are a drone looking in on the action. Yeah some lemon haze half way in was a good choice for me. Better than a video game! Hard to believe I did not know so many of the spoilers since I followed the online info pretty closely. Over the last few pandemic years. Keanu is the quintessential action movie star. John Wick IS the wrathful deity. I have heard it will be available for streaming in May. I'll be running it all day.Not for kids. Do NOT let your ex husband take little kids cuz he wants to see it. The good news is that it has intergenerational appeal as long as you are over 14 .
20,"This has to the best action movie I have ever seen, I have to say I'm shocked to see the 4th movie in a cinematic universe be the best yet. It's non stop action from start to finish. Keanu is one of the greatest action stars to ever live. I really hope they make more. The fight choreography is second to none, the gun play better than ever, and the casting is stupendous. The plot is top notch, the Wickverse is better than the Marvel Universe and any film universe. He deserves all the plaudits for what he has done with this character. You need to see this movie multiple times. Best film I have seen at the cinema in a very long time.."
21,"Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet. Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie."
22,"If stunning fight scenes are your thing you'll be in awe, as the battles start quite soon and lead to more, hand to hand, with guns and swords, not much dialogue, no time for words, as the blood is spilt, the casualties do soar. The geography begins in New York City, not too later in Osaka things get gritty, Berlin really bares its teeth, as several more become deceased, and in Paris things get wild, and somewhat tricky.Nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps not on this scale, as The High Table appoint a Marquis to remove John Wick and all he represents, employing traditional tactics and approaches not unbecoming of a film of this nature."
23,"It's awesome to see how John Wick franchise has progressed, four movies in and it still has that same aesthetic, top to bottom, this film was just amazing. The editing was spot on, the scenery and focal shots are amazing, All of the actors were outstanding, the effects were some of the greatest I have ever seen, and the variety in the fight sequences was refreshing and new. The director and writer really nailed the action and entertainment in this movie. Honestly I was little worried that they couldn't keep up with the franchise going at such a high level, I'm glad it was not the case with this one."
24,"If you enjoyed JW 1-3, you can't miss this one. It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.And the magic!First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.Now, why only 8 points?Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that."
25,"This is by far the best action movie to come out the past 15 years! Yup, I said it and stand by it! Can you find a movie character more exciting than John Wick?? Jason Bourne is a close second but the visuals in this franchise make this series fun to watch.Fast forward to this installment where the stakes are higher for John Wick. There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film is fast and exciting.One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch. It's hard not to think about what happen recently with his passing while promoting this movie. Other supporting characters make it woke up until the very end but Reddick will be missed."
26,"Yes, you can absolutely feel the length, there is no way you wouldn't feel the length, besides the obvious, nit picky here and there, John Wick: Chapter 4 fills with the best character in the franchise so far, Bill Skarsgård was a menacing great villain, another best one in the franchise, Donnie Yen was a badass in this movie, and Keanu Reeves as the great John Wick, killing it again in the role, and the rest of the cast were all great, John Wick: Chapter 4 was the grandest of them all, in terms of a story and action, clocking at 2 hours and 49 minutes, Wick's at his god mode giving some of the most brutal, exciting, and epic action scene in movie history, as a whole, John Wick: Chapter 4 was really something else, something that you never seen before, in it's length, the movie offers you a whole complete story fills with an exciting, intense, brutal, and epic action, great story, and great characters, it's a hell of a great wild memorable one time movie watch experience, second best in the franchise below Parabellum and above the rest."
27,"This chapter of JW was really amazing; action-packed, compelling, funny and star-filled. I was definitely enthralled and it never left you anywhere but on the edge of your seat. I found it to be engaging, funny, and thrilling while still feeling heartwrenching and shocking in so many different and unexpected ways. It was a movie that our entire family enjoyed and I feel Keanu hit the ball out of the park, per usual. This franchise is summarized in a bittersweet way but the ride is worth the ending nevertheless. Five huge stars for a wonderful ensemble cast! Loved this movie and really think most fans will too."
28,"John Wick 4 is an incredible addition to the action franchise. The film takes the series to new heights with even more intense fight scenes and a thrilling storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Keanu Reeves delivers another outstanding performance as the iconic hitman, and the supporting cast brings their A-game as well. Without giving away any spoilers, I can confidently say that John Wick 4 exceeds all expectations and is a must-see for fans of the series and action movie lovers alikeit's the best John wick and all of the characters that are added do an amazing job beat villains."
29,"SCORE: 7.2/10The biggest roller coaster of roller coasters I've ever been on while watching a movie in theaters. It was good, then it was bad, then it was great, then boring, then absolutely amazing, then disappointing. If we are speaking solely about the Action, this was the greatest Action movie of all time. Every fight was legendary and the new tricks and weapons they used were unlike anything I've ever seen before. The exploding shotgun, the ultra-realistic fighting choreography, and the entire world getting bossed up by Mr. Wick. If the movie were just all of the fight scenes mashed together, this may have been a perfect movie. However, unfortunately, as movies tend to go, there also happens to be a story element to them. And for John Wick 4, it was atrocious and easily the worst story in the franchise.Anytime the new villain was on screen it was a complete snooze fest, apart from the end where he gets a bullet in the head. Some of those scenes went on way too long and made some of the Action scenes less impactful because of what we had to go through to get there. I was excited when I saw the 2hr and 49 minute runtime, as I loved the first 3 John Wicks, but this movie had no business being that long. So much of it should've been cut out. There was way too much plot armor given to the head of security for the High Table and the guy he meets the card table, which made it felt forced at times. I have no problem with all the plot armor given to John Wick, but I was not a fan of those other characters being portrayed in that way.Now for the 2 most problematic parts of the movie. For one, can they make up their mind when it comes to the relationship between John and Caine and the Tracker? They're fighting against each other and then working together and then fighting against each other and then working together and then half fighting against each other and half working together. It felt sloppy and inconsistent in a way that was not productive. Lastly, HE DIES? You have got to be kidding me. It's not just the fact that he dies, but it's the way it happens. Granted, there is probably a 99% chance he's still alive, but absolutely nothing in his final conversation with Caine and Winston made me thinking he was dying. And now he just collapses over on the stairs and it cuts to his tombstone? For everything he was able to endure throughout the 4 films, it was a pretty pathetic way to end the movie and it felt like a slap in the face. John Wick deserved way better. We also still got virtually nothing about his wife apart from a single flashback, an element that should've been explored by now.This movie review is long because I'm very passionate about John Wick and I love his character and the movies that came before this one. To end on a positive note, there were still a bunch of good things that happened in this film that were just unfortunately watered down by the length of the film and the rest of the story. The humor was phenomenal, both Caine and the Tracker's character were great additions, and there were a lot of high impact scenes, such as John saving the Tracker's dog. Lastly, RIP to the legend Lance Reddick. I know he didn't have a major part in this movie, but he has given a memorable performance in each of the prior movies and was so talented. Taken from us way too soon."
30,"I saw so many action movies even all the previous John Wick movies and i need to say that this movie put the standard pretty high. The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacré coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest). A nice action movie. No doubt about it."
31,"Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before."
32,"My God! I just got back from a movie theatre and man! Oh man! John Wick : Chapter 4 is the best sequel of the series and one of the greatest action films ever made! You've got so many amazing stars, awesome fight scenes and stunts with a straight up simple plot that is kill or be killed in its absolutely biggest way in this spectacular sequel... Keanu Reeves is always the show stealer as its titular character with his badass performance and stunts... Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick reprise their roles and as usual they were great... Also I've got to say the new cast of the John Wick franchise, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins, Clancy Brown, Hiroyuki Sanada and the rest of them were all awesome as well... So far I feel this is my number 1 movie of the year... If you're already a John Wick fan, you're gonna be mindblown in your seats and if you're not, trust me, you're gonna be a fan soon..."
33,"I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it."
34,"This movie has the same plot as before: John Wick against the rest of the assassin world with longer running time. What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!. I really want the movie to be finished asap.However, as I said, the character development is nice and the gun-fu which are shot from above from room to room is also memorable. I quite enjoyed them. 7/10."
35,"HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense."

37,"Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes
John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes
John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes
John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutesNotice how the films got long & long with each entry...!Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!4/10 & that's generous considering!"
38,"Its also ridiculous,. Outrageous, ludicrous, and hilarious. They have uncut action scenes that last for minutes now. Easily the overall best action stunt movie for the art. Simple story and Wick indestructible. But so worth it. Fighting up an endless staircase against innumerable foe to the music of Justice. Bravo. The most imaginative chorography fight scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can it not be the perfect action movie created. From fists to firearms this movie does not miss a beat. The best of the best of the best fight scenes. Take a bow."
39,"Think it's gone too far past how great JW1 was,just over hyped now. How is all this action happening with no police any where?A blind man shooting people but no one can shoot him ?? The main body guard for the main villain should of been killed plenty of times,JW puts bullets in people who you know are dead but leaves this guy in the middle of the road when he's the main threat??How is all the violance happening in the street and night club and no one batters an eye lid ??why did he leave the underground to go to the church that's obviously miles away to then end up in a shootout ? Surly he got of go there easier ? The overlay of the radio DJ at the end was annoying,how did she know where he wa aging to be constantly??"
40,"He should set an example for the rest of the action films, as John Wick's character is not an ordinary character. I hope a statue of him will be placed inside the Hollywood Museum. In terms of photography, it is very good and second to none, as well as accuracy and adjustment on some small things. They have great capabilities, and we do not forget the sound and other effectsWe waited for John Wick for a long time, just waiting for the showtime in Iraq cinema, to feel alive thanks to this elephant. Thank you Keanu Reeves and thank you to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
41,"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive. Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.The sad thing is this is the same with Balayya movies, but when it directed and taken in Hollywood people go crazy!An average movie 6/10."
42,"I loved the movie. It was a slightly longer movie. The action scenes and fight scenes were also very good. Keanu Reeves was perfect for this role. Yeeahh :) Some scenes in the movie bothered me. Especially the scenes of not bleeding and cops scenes, but still, I think it was very good. It was fun to watch in the cinema. Same scenese were funnish. It wasn't necessary. Also, the shooting scenes were very good. At the same time, the disco scene, the scene shot from above, looked very epic. I was blown away by these scenes. The ending of the movie was a bit simplistic so the ending was disappointing."
43,"Action and Keanue Reaves, are just a part of this stunning movie. There is a real artwork and hard work inside. I can't find anything negative about this movie. Every detail is great from bottom to top. Isometric scenes are so clever, insane and perfect. Maybe the scenario is not much deep but you don't even notice it as you watch it with your eyes wide open and breath deep. Music is amazing, sounds are awesome, action never stops until the end, scenes are very artistic , and the cast is very good. Probably I will see it again soon. Maybe I see it third time too. God I can't wait to see it again."
44,"Wtf, 10s from people? This was the worst one yet and Chapter three sucked ass!Over, over the top. People dancing while others are killed around them, cars keep driving on like a damn marry go round even though people are killed like flies. He survives being hit by a car at full speed not once but 5! Times in 5 minutes. Oh, and falls from a building (again) and totals the car but just walks off.And then they try to be funny with the dog biting nuts, him rolling down the stairs like it's an episode of Family guy.And to top it all off, the blind guy shoots better than John f'n Wick.Give me a f'n break.The only reason for not giving it a 1* is cus I like Keanu."
45,"Stunning installment. Beautifully crafted action sequences. The camerawork is impeccable. The fight choreography is fantastic. Keanu continues to own the John Wick role. Donnie Yen bringing all his skills to the table. This sequel just ramps up everything this franchise represents. A Clean, sleek, modern action flick. This film is a masterclass of peak cinema. The set pieces are on another level. Insert more praise. This is the one. Definitely recommend checking this out. The cinematography alone is worth a watch. Real locations. The set design. It's peak. It's everything you want out of a movie."
46,"The best Wick has have ever been. Chapter 4 is the perfect combination of action styles (martial arts, samuria, gunfoo, western - it's all there) with a great story, this is a hell of a time at the movies!With the price on his head ever increasing, legendary hit man John Wick takes his fight against the High Table global as he seeks out the most powerful players in the underworld, from New York to Paris to Japan to Berlin. Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, he must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes."
47,"I truly loved this movie. So much bad a** action. The music was just so awesome too. The fight scenes were just so cool, but I did think they lasted a little too long, and there is no way someone is walking away from what John Wick went through in all of it. It did run wayyyy too long on all of the fight scenes even tho they were great. I loved all the actors. This is just one of those great action movies that just hit the spot for me. The dog was a fun addition, and I assume that the person with the dog will show up again in future movies. I highly recommend this movie if action is your thing. Great fun."
48,"John Wick is not only a movie, it's a emotion that uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But prior he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against all the odds and a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe. With base story the movie prceeds as John Wick, a professional hitman and assassin who has gained legendary reputation for his set of skills and is now hunted by the High Table.John returns to NYC and meets with Winston who himself seeking revenge against the High Table - suggests that John challenge de Gramont to a duel, as winning will free him of his obligation to the High Table. As per the Table's traditions, John can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family; seeing as he previously severed his ties to the Ruska Roma, John travels to their headquarters in Berlin to receive a new crest marking his membership to the syndicate."
49,"I like to watch people getting killed. Give me a movie where people are getting killed for 3 hours and I'll be happy. Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version. The rabble, ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy. John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of humour. After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcorn. Kenau Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got millions and what do we do? Portraying human ugliness like it is sexy."
50,"I am so happy this movie turned out to be an actual blast firing on all cylinders. Keanu Reeves has never been this good in the series: the stunts and the gravitas he brings to both the character and the film are superb. He and the while team behind the film have been wise enough too to surround him by a whole pack of terrific players (The Blind Man, Mr. Nobody) in order to enhance the experience. There are some breathtaking tracking shots and the main action sequences (Osaka, Germany and Paris) are outstanding. Paris is definitely my favourite. Culminating with a daring, bold surprising ending 'John Wick Chapter 4' is everything you want in a movie now. Go and see it now!"
51,"My weekend ended with finishing the final installment of the John Wick series. I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole ""tracker"" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as ""loving husband"" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings."
52,"It's like they thought about how to shoot every type of action scene in its absolute perfection and the most beautiful way, and just went ahead and did it. Almost three hour-long action spectacle that feels non-stop but they do take enough time in between to stop and breathe and those are some genuine breaths using the heart. Even though this and first is my favourite in the franchise, they did stretch the logic to the maximum in this. The way the action works and the world works in this movie felt like it used video game logic, the health bar fills up if you stay still and the NPCs are only scared for a second and go back to what they do if you don't bother them. Nonetheless, this is a theatre experience like none other."
53,"Having watched all the prequels to this high octane action film .I was excited for the sequel to be released in the theatres shortly ,having gotten the opportunity to watch an early screening of the film before its theatrical release I was hyped as I had read somewhere that this time the bogeyman takes on the high table itself . And believe me I was not disappointed though a bit slow paced at the beginning the moment John Wick start on a killing spree the action sequences, gunfights are so good and satisfying that it kept me to the edge of the seat and willing to cheer him for every enemy he takes down. Donnie yen, Scott Adkins, Hiroyuki Sanada were icing on the cake."
54,"Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing."
55,"After so many unnecessary movies and series that flattered all segments that did everything for the sake of being watched , you really came out for a wonderful series The BOOGEYMAN as JOHN WICK.Being. An ardent fan since the release of the first one , I've been cautious going into each subsequent film. Waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise .This movie did the exact opposite . Waaaay over the top action , infused with a lot more humour and tongue-in-cheek sequence , this movie deliver . So much so , i was disappointed.....at the last and more disappointed about not coming John Wick 5..."
56,"I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic Blonde.I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along. The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
57,"So.... I thought I loved JW. I certainly love the first one. Imo, the first JW is one of the best action movies of all time. It was a story with heart - it had a reason for being. And I realized about myself, what I love most in a movie are the parts where you a) discover the protagonist's ""powers"" b) learn about a new world and 3) real people doing extraordinary things. That was my JW, the Baba Yaga. A legend brought back to life because someone stole his car and took his dog. Perfection.Fast forward till now and over hours of my life, JW has eroded into some kind of cartoon. The man should be in a full body cast at all times but no, he just bounces around like a rubber ball, seemingly mad at himself at certain points because he keeps getting back up. The premise of JW is that he's an extraordinarily TALENTED man - not Wolverine - yet he is now a superhero. And much of this movie didn't make sense - why wasn't his rage directed at Winston?!? He was the one who betrayed him in the 3rd movie. His reasons for all his actions aren't compelling at all any more....in reality, if he's THIS MAD he should be going after the cancer research centers that didn't save his wife.If all that you ever loved about JW is the shooting, well, this will be your jam. There's plenty. But...it's not good. Not like the OG. Sigh."
58,"After a pretty pathetic JW3, this sequel does deliver. JW3 suffered from boring and repetitive fight scenes: it seemed like a video game where headshot quantity was important. I literally fell asleep around 90 min in. JW4 recovers nicely, and is definitely worth seeing. A much better plot, with great and well-choreographed fight scenes. The spice is back. And great, aggressive cinematography, too. Eye candy, with attractive on location shots from Berlin and Paris. Yes, there is the obligatory empowered female fighter, but her role is limited to killing only 10-12 300 lb mercenaries. And the obligatory white male villain, but good news! He's French! So we can despise him regardless of sex or ethnicity. Of course it's not a JW sequel unless the laws of physics are suspended, but if you buy the premise, you'll buy the gag. Worth the watch."
59,First 15mins were kinda slow but then screenplay took off. One of the best action movies. The stunts were ballistic... a few logical flaws but it's a cult classic for sure. Should have trimmed the running length though. What started with a dog has got a fitting farewell after 4 installments. John and his charisma steals the show. Unexpected performance from Donnie. A benchmark has been set with Cinematography. The aerial shots fight sequence reminded me of GTA 1 and 2. Keanne has done full justice to his role. Worth a watch. Hope the makers would reboot the storyline with a new character in the future.
60,"The culmination of arguably the best action franchise of all time. Keanu Reeves gives an incredible performance as John Wick as always. From the opening scene the film grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. Every fight scene (and there is a lot of them) takes place in the most gorgeous places with stunning almost otherworldly lighting. The cinematography is insanely good and a treat for the eyes. Choosing the action set pieces to take place in Osaka to Berlin to Paris gives the feeling that you as the spectator are being taken on a journey, thereby justifying the almost 3 hour run time. Donnie Yen's character; Cain and The Tracker are instant fan favourites and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future. A fantastic film with a satisfying ending that leaves nothing to be desired. Well done to everyone involved. 10/10."
61,"The greatest action film ever made. Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet. Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie. This franchise eclipses Tom Cruise and the Mission films. A+ film."
62,"Unrealistic action but still loaded with outstanding and unique fight scenes that were thoroughly enjoyable. Even my wife, who usually watches Lifetime movies and hasn't seen John Wick 1-3, enjoyed it and now wants to see the first three films. Great cast too! Not as much humor as the first three classic films but the pace and story made an almost three hour movie go quickly. We will definitely watch part four several times. Thank you Keanu Reeves for another great movie. Movies like this must be seen in a theater and will help the movie industry recover from several weak years of sub-par movies (other than Top Gun 2)!"
63,"Coming in the 4 installment of the John Wick series with everything that has happened in the previous 3 I was wondering what was going to happen in this one. And boy it was magnificent. Keanu Reeves had already solidified himself as a legend through the Matrix series but with the conclusion of this movie he overcame whatever he did while acting as Neo. The choreography was the best I've ever seen in any action movie and it never felt boring. For a movie almost 3 hours long it never got boring you were always hyped up about what's going to happen next. The camera work was phenomenal following Wick to iconic places such as Japan, Sahara Desert(probably),Paris,Berlin,New York etc. But what I really appreciated about this movie was that despite having less dialogue than action you really had feelings about the other characters than John. Caine's character (Donnie Yen) was tremendous at his job. He made himself a believable blind men without making his character such as Daredevil. When you first saw you him you instantly hated him but with the movie progressing you started to like him. Marquis (Bill Skasgard) gave you the vibe of a hateful villain from the start and keeping that vibe irritating you through the whole movie. The tracker (Shamier Anderson) was a fun character also being more a anti-hero than a villain giving us memories from the first John Wick with his dog. And the comeback of some iconic characters such as Charon,Winston and King. And in the end a very sad but also nice conclusion with the villain ending up dead Caine and his daughter being saved and John finally resting joining his wife in the afterlife and making himself the name of the most notorious person in the underworld. The Babayaga!And movie to be remembered through the years."
64,"First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsgård, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home."
65,"So yeah I loved it, but don't worry my review won't be only fan based or with any kind of spoilers, but as we've all waited 4 years it's really worth watching in Cinemas because Movie is really great and Action is too realistic and also Acting from Keenu Reeves, and as i said i don't wanna write a whole story but still i had to fill remaining 256 required characters so yeah whoever reading my review I insist or recommend this movie John wick Chapter 4, You go must watch it I'm giving it 10/10 Because i really loved it, I was already excited but this made me more happy that was more than expected like from previous movies of Franchise it's also one of the Best Action movies!"
66,"It amazes me how each subsequent John Wick film not only expands the world building, which keeps it interesting from a story perspective, but also manages to up the action to unbelievable levels. This entry is no exception. And they've not only upped the action of the previous entries in this franchise, but they've singlehandedly outclassed every other movie in the genre at the same time.Just the three action sets pieces toward the final 90 minutes of the film blow every other film in the genre out of the water. I'm still in awe and headed back to IMAX for a second viewing.For action fans, believe the hype... it doesn't get any better than this."
67,"I wasn't interested in watching this movie because I knew what I'm going to get, but my friend told me that we've watched Chapter 3, and we've come this far, so we might as well just watch chapter 4. The result was just as I expected. It was just the same as Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or ""franchise"" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some turns to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it would be still enjoyable, but it's too late to stop this ""cliche train"" starting from John Wick chapter 3, Nobody, Bullet Train, Violent night, and this John Wick: Chapter 4. I don't think this franchise will die any time soon. They are probably working another movies in John Wick universe right now."
68,"I do not have the words to explain how much fun I had while watching this movie! The cinematography is stunning to say the least, and the action is everything you could possibly want! Every character in this movie was brilliant and executed with the upmost, talent and charisma! I cannot wait to watch chapter 4 again and again and again! I truly believe that this franchise is by far the best action franchise ever created! Thank you, Chad and Keanu for creating a masterpiece. Chapter 4 nailed it, and I could not be any more proud of the production team for creating this world for all of us to live in and enjoy."
69,"I had some doubt on how they're gonna do better than chapter 3. Well they've done better than previous movies. Pure two and half hours of action entertainment. Cinematography was top level, hats off to Keanu reeves and other people associated with stunt. Something like this will never be ever filmed. This film will set example for current and upcoming generation like Terminator 2 and Die hard was to us. I've seen so many classic and critically acclaimed films from all over world. This is what we needed. Totally worth my time and scene points. Must be watched on screen as much big as possible.."
70,"I don't even know where to start. I love John Wick 1-3 and saw all three of them 2-3 times in theatres, with more repeat viewings at home.John Wick 4 is an awful mockery of everything that made the franchise good. It is far too long and overindulgent - some filler shots go on for 20-30 seconds when they could have been 5 - and the movie lacks the kinetic realism of all the previous entries. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and even unnecessary at times, and plot is completely nonsensical.WHY does he drive in circles around the Arc de Triomphe when he could just drive Montmarte? He later drives the motorcycle there...How is the Eiffel Tower the closest the Bowery King can get him to Montmarte? That's where he was right before that!!Ugh, and don't get me started on the Marquis nonsense. It's the worst kind of one-up-manship - illogical, unfounded, and a pure plot contrivance.Hard pass."
71,This movie met every one of my expectations! It delivered with the great action of a typical John Wick action but also had other compelling story lines and the one liners you would expect. The actions scenes are top notch but they always have an undertone of rules and respect that makes it really enjoyable. The lighting was great and even with endless action they still made you really enjoy the characters. The storyline was simple and straight forward but keeps you engaged through out the whole movie. The ending was unpredictable which i really appreciated and I felt keeps me excited. It was not meant to be repetitive and ruin the franchise. It told a story and stuck to the code of the movie. This movie knows exactly what it is and did it 10 out of 10. Amazing.
72,"I was entertained throughout. The almost three hour run time felt like 20 minutes. Amazing fight sequences, over the top, ridiculous but the film knows that and plays on it. I loved all the films and was a little worried they may have over stretched it with a fourth instalment. I was wrong, it was the icing on the cake. Immensely satisfying and very well filmed. There is an amazing aerial sequence where you see John Wick shoot the bad guys moving through different rooms ( much like a computer game, which I think was its intension). I had the widest smile when it paid a deliberate homage to another classic from the 1970s, The Warriors. If you want Oscar nominated deep and meaningful stuff, this is not for you. If you want an escape from reality and have a great three hours of mindless violence, superb choreography, not much of a story, this is for you. The director has put together a masterclass of an action movie together, the body count alone goes into hundreds and goodness knows how long it took for the actors to do all the stunts. Sheer joy, hugely recommended."
73,"Absolutely one of the best examples of fight choreography, (hand to hand, blade, Judo, Gun-Fu) in films in many many years. Without spoiling anything for those that havent seen it yet, it is an action movie masterpiece. From the opening parlay, to the crescendo. Even including what appeared to be a tongue in cheek commercial for a new Taran Tactical Innovations release lol. Skäarsgäard is stellar at drawing fan heat as the/one of the new bad guy(s). As a huge fan some of the directions of this film and its outcomes leave one to contemplate other entries ideas and/or spin-off opportunities with the loss of one of the best cast members. But, true fans of the Wick series should be more than pleased, I know I was. I was also greatly pleased at the near 3 hour run time, so I wasnt left wanting for material that would require nearly that time, shoved into the usual 90-120 min runtimes to appease to the TikTok generation. Thankfully this fleshed out well and completely. Enjoy folks!"
74,"What a conclusion to John Wick quadrilogy. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Absolutely brilliant action sequences, stunning lighting and beautiful cinematography. It has got everything. This movie has taken action movie genre to a whole new level and has earned the Legendary status in my books.Chad Stahelski being a stuntman himself has proved why nobody could have directed John Wick better than he did. The locations where action sequences take place are carefully chosen.I never write movie reviews but this movie forced me to write my first ever review on IMDB. I was in awe when the movie ended and left the theatre with a happy heart. It was perfect in all sense."
75,"Truly, the main selling point of this movie, that is the high octane action sequences, saves this movie from some, if not a lot, of its flaws. Just sit back and enjoy, rid yourself of the remaining little care you have for the world for the moment and witness what John must endure throughout the film that it would automatically drive you to think: ""How the hell is he still alive ?"". One thing that I found pretty funny about this movie is that it almost feels like a modern console action-adventure game, in which the story involves a side quest that John needs to complete to further the plot and get closer to its completion.8.5/10."
76,"By far one of the best John Wick movies I've seen. If I may say, one of the best action movies I've ever seen even. The way he performs while using a gun just majestic. The way he tackles and takes an enemy down so aggressively but also with thought. The driving skills he's got with such precise kills in taking his enemy down just flawless. The movie consists of perfect story to action ratio with just perfect timing and execution between the both!Reminded me of the old John Wick movies, but with a touch of spice which brought this to a perfect ending possibly. May just be the end but was a perfect end."
77,"John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet."
78,"Total score compiled by:
N: 10/10
M: 9.5/10
I: 9/10
F: 7.5/10Reasoning (N);
Absolute perfect way to not only do an action movie but also end the mainline run of a franchise with dignity. All of the original characters have a satisfactory conclusion to their character arcs and even newer characters make you instantly make you wish for a standalone movie to know more about their own story. I feel for all the people waiting for a slow moment in the movie so that they can go to the toilet because those scenes are basically non-existent. The scene elevating this movie from a 9 to 10 for me personally is in Paris when everything suddenly transitions into a top-down view (reminiscent of games like hotline miami). The scene then transitions back into the normal third person view and back again into the top-down perspective. All of this looking like a seamless one-shot. Sure, there were some noticeable green-screen shots towards the end but that didn't make the action shots before any less cool."
79,"The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all...
To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable 😂)."
80,"The best John Wick sequel ever. I didn't expect that to be better than I thought. Almost 3 hours of full action with different action styles in different countries. I have always loved this detail in this series and the previous one. Sometimes you couldn't guess what will happen. Must watch it at a theater.John Wick series has written its own name with gold letters in the movie industry. When it is released digitally, I would like to finish all of them. You can feel the connection between the first and last. Sequel names are given as ""Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four"". These are not a joke. Really a four-part full story."
81,"This movie have best action this is the best John Wick movie all actor work best but also this time the villain is not good but 14 action sequence was mind blowing. But Hindi dubbed was not good that I was hoping but whool movie was the action
This is the longest John Wick movie and I love it movie was great and stunts are also mind bloiwng. I also loved all three John Wick movies but this is different and this is the best John Wick movie also John Wick one villain was best but after John Wick all three movies good villain I will hoping John Wick 5 have good villain but overall the movie was very awesome you can watch this movie on theatre."
82,"The film is an action lover's dream. Filled with spectacular gun battles and chase scenes also the magnificent presence of Donnie Yen doing what he does best, overall continuation of the story from episode 3, this film is mostly one man's journey in getting revenge for disturbing his once peaceful existence, his previous life as Hitman or corporate assassin was only a memory until they killed the last living thing he cared about, the they as in his previous employer is now who he is on a mission to destroy completely, while the film is lacking in storytelling, it excels in giving the viewer a very colorful and highly stylized set pieces across several countries, which was quite impressive in my opinion, I also liked the kudo's to the film the Warriors for a particular reference to the DJ and the grandiose finale that had a taste of Sergio Leone spaghetti western sprinkled in for good measure, if there is any time to go back to the theater, well this is the movie to watch, if you are an action film lover, you will not be disappointed with this film."
83,"The fighting scenes are still exciting, the combination of shooting scenes with Keanu Reeves' martial arts is cool as usual, plus there's Donnie Yen who looks really cool in this film. The storyline is actually good, but there are a few things that don't match expectations. The climax of the fourth film is also a bit unfortunate, it's not as exciting as the climax of the third film (Chapter 3 - Parabellum). There are also several characters whose fate is still unclear. It shouldn't be finished in one film in a hurry, but two films can be made so that it gives a clear conclusion for all the characters. That's just my opinion, anyway. Overall, this film is still recommended, especially for those who like the hitman-assassin action genre, you really have to watch it. Hopefully this fourth film will not be the last John Wick film, because I still want to watch Baba Yaga hunting again."
84,"It's top notch action sequences. Will easily watch 3,4 times in iMAX. Beyond action the story was touching with dark comedies. It's one of my top 10 favorite movie. Don Y, was classy with many one word, one line jokes. You got Knief, swords, pistols, lots of pistols, tons of pistols, automatic riffle, cars, motor bikes, horse and the best and my favorite was nunchuks. Keanu made it all look real. Can see the level effort he put on the stunt sequence. Came angle from the roof POV was awesome. Fight in steps was mind blowing. Climax was like cherry on top. Not the end end, the one before. Trying to be mindful with no spoilers. Enjoy the movie in iMAX people."
85,"To the best of my knowledge, I've never left a review nor had the desire. Well , Mr. Wick changed that in a little over two hours. Wow is an understatement.Watch it, stay after the credits, you'll not be disappointed. Rarely see someone make the absolute most of every single frame of film but after twice treating myself to viewings, I can say that's been accomplished !!!!Even the runtime seemed daunting at first but the pacing is superb and you don't even notice. If I had to absolutely muster up a complaint, my personal one would be the main villain . To be head of the table and know so much, about I'd have pegged him for older."
86,"In one word, it was wonderful to see such a wonderful movie after such a long time. I feel proud to have seen such a great hero's movie. His action at this age is still amazing and memorable. I was very eager to watch this movie sat with great interest till the end of the day now I got my desired goal. I think the movie should have a better release. I am waiting for this movie to come in Bangladesh because until this movie comes in Bangladesh I will not be able to go and see it in the hall.

87,"John wick is just not a movie, it's a representation of action genre. The background, the cam movement everything is perfectly executed In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact his revenge against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the only individual above the High Table.Because of this, New York Continental Hotel manager Winston Scott and his concierge, Charon, are summoned to the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a senior member of the High Table, who chastises Winston for his failure to assassinate John. To punish Winston, de Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, has the Continental destroyed, and kills Charon. He then travels to Paris and enlists Caine, a blind, retired High Table assassin and old friend of John's, to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise."
88,"This film is the fourth film from Franchise John Wick and has the longest time of about 169 minutes. The film was directed by the same person and the same main actor namely Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves, as well as newcomers such as Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Lance Reddick, Ian Winston, Rina Sawayama, Scott Adkins and many more. This film tells John Wick who wants to be free from high tables and look for ways to be free from the ex communicado and the only way to fight the high table itselfCons:
-Fight Scene that repetitive from the previous film uses the same method and there are some scenes using the same style in fighting itPros:-Sound that is very supportive of the Cons earlier, the fight scene, every background of the sound is so beautiful and very suitable for fighting or dialogue.-Cematography is very beautiful like I play video games. Image drawing in this film is really next level of all other Hollywood action films-Ating Donnie Yen here is super cool and stealing the show besides that Keanu Reeves also looks more brutal and crazy as Rina Sawayama whose acting is so cool-Storyline is super beautiful and maybe one of the best storyline for the best franchise movie in the action film is very beautiful and great-World Building The broad makes this film can explore this franchise further-Artistik Fight and Color Grading which is very beautiful makes this film much better than the previous film that distinguishes here the choreographer has a fighting style and art that is really strong so it is different from other action filmsVerdictThis film is the greatest film John Wick and even the best action in 2023. This film has all the existing aspects ranging from great action sequences, and from the beginning it is already tense which makes this film top notch and help from the sound, editing, cinematography, acting and manuscripts that make this film is a film that is suitable to be watched for lovers Action film and maybe this is the most beautiful work for an action franchise film in the world. (P. S: There is 1 Post Credit Scene that is still connected to the world of John Wick) 😊Rating: 10/10Reviewed on IMAX Cinemas."
89,"For me this is CINEMA. After infinity war if I called something cinema it is John Wick 4. What a screenplay, what a great mouth watering cinematography, what a standard defining Action Scenes. Don't miss this on theaters guys. It has everything to it : Love, Friendship, Brotherhood, Sacrifice, Parenthood, Family, Revenge ( every emotional aspect of a huma life has been challenged here). I can watch this atleast a dozen times more.From start to finish, the flow of the story, the character development makes you sit at edge. Suspense was spot on, everything will be there infront us and still we fail to get what's coming. And when you finally arrive at that stake, the story had already been increased the stake before you realise.Cinematography, CGI, Action Choreography, Background music everything was spot on."
90,"If you're like me and have been less than thrilled with the recycled superhero, boring, propaganda-infused migraines that have been in the theaters for the last few years, then here's your sign to go: John Wick Chapter 4. Being an ardent fan since the release of the first one, I've been cautious going into each subsequent film, waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise. This movie did the exact opposite. Waaaaay over the top action, infused with a lot more humor and tongue-in-cheek sequences, this movie delivers. So much so, I was disappointed to hear there may not be a fifth chapter (as was originally planned), not to mention saddened by the passing of Lance Reddick. The John Wick universe stays fresh and fun four movies in and does not disappoint. Hopefully this isn't the end (insert John Wick's subdued response, ""Yeah"")!"
91,I just have to give this chapter of John Wick 10/10. The action set pieces are absolutely incredible and some choreography must've taken days if not weeks to get everyone prepared for the scenes. The inclusion of the new characters brings freshness to the movie and the don't feel out of place.John is carrying on his journey for freedom while taking on the Marquis DeGramont & his henchmen to arrive at a destination by sunrise and the journey there is just non stop action.The pacing of the movie runs perfectly and you never get tired or boredThe ending of the movie is and will be decisive to people and for me I'm happy with the ending...don't know what to think about the end credit scene though !If you loved the first 3 in this franchise then I believe you'll thoroughly enjoy this chapter from Mr Reeves and Mr Stahlelski.
92,"I don't know how to describe this masterpiece of art. In a century of CGI and cut scene massacres. Best to describe it: I'm thankful being able to see the best action movie in the 21 century.I enjoyed every dialogue, every scene, every perspective and - of course - every headshot. The whole movie is well thought out. Every second has the right to exist. In my 24 years of human being I was never hyped like this. My expectation was 10/10. The movie just had to disappoint me. But it didn't. It surpassed my expectations.I talked to a friend and we both said that we could talk one hour about every scene. The desert-horse scene. The Tokyo-continental scene. The German-Club scene. The Paris-car scene. The shotgun-onetake scene. The Paris-stair scene. The dog scenes. The duel scene. And of course those little partly funny partly crazy scenes (for instance the dog pissing on somebody's face after demolishing him or the arrow in the knee upside down scene).Every character is perfectly selected. And of course the story line and those details about the John Wick universe is well picked.This is a masterpiece of art. Thanks Mr Reeves."
93,"I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be."
94,"This movie is a action cinematic masterpiece
Keanu Reeves blew it out of the park with his scintillating performance
Chad Stahelski mesmerizes us with his insane action and cinematography
John Wick 4 reminded me why i love cinema the magical feeling you get when you eat something special
This movie is that feeling and more
The world building the characters and the underlying tragedy of one of the greatest characters ever created John Wick
Easily the best film in the franchise and what a film it was keeping us on the edge of our seats in the action scenes awing us with its character interactions and last but not least to see this beautiful journey come to an end put tears in my eyes
Keanu Reeves was perfect as John Wick a match made in heaven he should win an Oscar for this performance some of my favourite things from the movie were him just walking his Sigma walk in an extreme wide shot in full black suit paralleled by pure white snowy backdrop just perfect."
95,"We get much of the same intense action in this installment of the John Wick franchise as we did from the first 3 movies. Near 3 hours of nonstop stunts and gunplay that will have you groaning in pain with the characters, laughing at some and on the edge of your seat at other times. However, one of the noticeable issues this time around is bad cgi at several points of the movie. This is especially noticeable in car chase scenes or when the assassins on John's trail are being hit by vehicles.The music was as fast paced as the action, no complaints there.However, can we all just agree that a fight in a club with multiple people dying isn't going to have people continue to dance around you?"
96,"I didn't see any other John Wick films before seeing this one and had no expectations beyond a gun fight movie starring Reeves.What transpired was an unnecessarily long movie with a script that felt stretched as far as it could go. The first half of the film felt like a serious of contrived action scenes. The Japanese segment droned on for at least twenty minutes just for Wick's old friend to be unnecessarily killed for dramatic effect.Then when the viewer is about to abandon all hope of any central storyline, it's revealed Wick can win his freedom by challenging Illuminati guy to a duel. Fair enough. What followed was another 30 minutes of fight scenes just for our guy to technically qualify for the duel.In the end Wick wins his freedom but he's shot up and presumably dies thereby invalidating the characters whole motivation during the whole film. If death was an accepting ending for him why didn't he just kill himself?Keanu Reeves looks old, tired, and depressed throughout much of this film. He talks slow and at times I wonder if he has early dementia. He's definitely not in his prime anymore and it shows. I'm of the opinion that action stars out of their prime should hang up the gloves and avoid intense action roles. They embarass themselves by providing a less impactful performance than what they were previously capable of.My favorite thing about this movie was the avoidance of shaky-cam. All the action scenes use steady-cam shots which allow the viewer to fully take in and understand the scene. While I didn't like the movie much, I am grateful to have supported (with my money) the continued use of steady-camera."
97,"John wick is a power house of action movie franchise,
1-3 were incredible for being an advancement in cinematography and choreography and incredible stunt work, so when they announced a fourth one, well, I was anticipating yet another awesome movie.I was... Half wrong; while giving me the action I wanted they stretched it for 3 hours with dead unimportant dialogue. 0 emotion.Every time they built tension in a scene and they stretched it too long, making the tension tiresome and boring, leaving me waiting for the action scenes to keep the plot going.In conclusion, for a fourth film that concludes a series, like the matrix, they should've let it go at the 3rd film."
98,"Very good addition to the series. Expanding into the realm of martial arts was a welcomed experience. The story picks up right where Jhn Wick 3 left off. Both old and new characters make help the storyline. John Wick Chapter 4 carries the same level of intensity and action as the previous movies. Though the movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes, John Wick Chapter 4 holds you in your seat from start to end (as usual). Recommendation, use the facilities first and hold it until the movie is over. I left two stars off because I fell John Wick 1 & 2 hold the remaining two stars. John Wick fans will be pleased. Very enjoyable movie."
99,"I went in with high expectations and was disappointed tbh.Lots of plot holes. The runtime is just padded with action that isn't that great. It's like a damn video game. Come on. The first John Wick is the best purely because the action feels real.The plot is also sorta weak. Few characters are not required at all for the plot to happen. Why did they need the whole blind angle? Why go the Daredevil path? WHY?! The tracker character was not required too. His presence didn't change the plot in any way at all.The fight scene, with the drone, before the end is basically a video game scene. Gotta be kidding me. As the ending scene developed, it was kinda predictable too. You mean tell me a god damn blind assassin is better than everyone else ? They are openly mocking us for giving them money for making dumb plots.I wouldn't have felt bad if I had skipped it. I am a huge John Wick fan. The first movie with the ""focus, commitment, sheer will"" inspired me. This one doesn't even have that line !Utterly disappointed."
100,"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time to call it a day."
101,"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical reviewJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsgård), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and protégé.The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass."
102,"Too much of something becomes boring.. killing a lot of people becomes boring after a while.. what's the point?Hollywood is so satanist that they try to be ale your light as much as they can.. the Cabal of s about murder and depression, destruction and chaos.. tgat of is why God decided that enough is enough when it comes to all the bad in the world.. I we are heading towards peace and Love and no amount. Of evil can destroy it this time. I am kind of glad it's the last one in the series because all that killing is counter productive... I mean what's the point? You live and then you die..!!!!!"
103,"This was definitely a wild ride. Saw a review saying John Wick getting shot at so much without getting shot was unrealistic. I mean the whole concept is unrealistic which is why he is the Baba Yaga. Also the bulletproof lining in the suits help.What was unrealistic was the fat guy being able to land a few kicks on John Wick. Now if he was more of a traditional boxer than a kicker, than would make more sense.Donnie Yen really ruled in this. My favorite thing he did in the film was (being blind) he use a barrel of the gun find a man's face so he could hit him. It was pretty sweet what they did with his character.I wish the daughter at the beginning had more of a presence, but in terms of female fighters, preferred her MUCH better than Halle Berry's character in chapter 3.Best part for my enjoyment was the fight in the old building. They did a single shot that panned out and gave a bird's eye view of the fight scene and it was awesome.Sadly, it looks like they may have actually buried John Wick in this one. However, I suspect Baba Yaga is not actually gone. When they were at his grave, John's dog turned and looked off in the distance so I'm wondering if he saw John.One sad part was the concierge being killed given the real life actor had passed away in real life.So not a 10/10 because of the fat guy being able to land size-able kicks, but all in all EPIC."
104,"John Wick 4 was everything you come to expect from a Wick movie and more. It was awesome. The kills were brutal and the choreography was amazing. The scene with the shotgun was 10/10. That long shot was probably my favorite Wick scene to date. The ending of the movie was perfect. I couldn't think of a more fitting end to the story. John Wick has planted itself as one of the greatest action franchises of all time. Each movie is better than the last, and the story never manages to lose control. I always expect the movies to fall off at some point, but they simply don't. These movies are fun, violent, and actually tell a great story."
105,"I am a big big John Wick fan. When i first saw it i was in love with the character and the idea and the freshness it brought to the table of action genre.We spend few last days before movie arrived in high expectations and when we saw 9/10 rating on imdb we were like this will be HUGE! Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott ""unrecognizable"" Adkins.Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe. Disgusting what they did with movie and character!To all John Wick fans who waited this so long and were si excited to see it.. you don't need to. Definitely not paying for it in cinemas! Stick to the first three movies and make some happy ending in your head. This is EPIC FAIL."
106,"Contains spoilers.I watched all 4 parts one by one in cinema. And starting from 1 to 4 it was getting worse. This part 4 looks like a joke parody on original.Here we have a blind killer! Who is even more dangerous than Wick himself. This is ridiculous.All those bulletproof suits. In the second part John got so much pain when someone shot him at least once into his armor. Now he does'nt feel like this is laser tag or something (not even paintbal).John falls from 4 floor on a car and casually stands up and keeps running. He got smashed by car on full speed like 5 times, no problem. Cars in the center of the city hit people multiple times, no one even stops. They kill each other in the club noone cares. Even in computer games you have more realism than here.Katana and sword fights when everyone have a gun. I know this is popular trick when Japan is concerned, but it looks quite not wise in this kind of movies.Falling from the stairs reminded me of jokes about injured Neymar that is rolling infinitely. What a joke.And last duel. Really? Duel with blind man.... Why? Why?? 3 hours, it got boring already, and now we get duel.The first 3 parts were so good, comparing to this. I don't get why people put 10 stars to this. I just don't know.This is my first review, but I just can't avoid writing how overhyped this movie is.5 and only from respect to Mr Keanu."
107,"Can't believe so many people give this movie 5 and above (so many 10s :/) I honestly loved the 1st JW movie, liked n°2 & 3 but this one, OMG! Just because the movie is filled with action scene doesn't make it a great movie. Honestly it's wayyyyyy too long, the rythm is bad, the John Wick character and arc are uninteresting as hell, other characters are under-developped, too many CGI, and OMG the ending just sucks a** There are some good fight scene in the movie, that can't be denied, but there are also way too many non-sense as well (e.g. The scene in the Berlin club where people keep dancing lik nothing is happening while bullets fly and axes are being burried in heads right and there, come on...). Don't know if this review will be helpful, be just be aware of the false hype. JW4 is not a good movie, sorry."
108,"JW C4 is the best movie in the franchise by far. I cant wait for C5. The move is action from beginning to the end. 2.45 running time goes very fast. The plot is well known, and it is done better this time. This is not a movie, it is art. This movie will stand as the best movie as CR has played in. If you love 1-2-3, this give you the finesse and thrill, all the other movies combined. We sat struck in the theater. The filming is ground braking. The sound is taking you inside of JW world. I hope to see this movie One time more in theater. A lot of details would be missed due to the focus you get in the scenes. This is must see for 2023. If you have not seen any of the other 3 movies. Go and see this. And you get a new friend. John Wick - all should have One friend like him."
109,"It's John Wick, what do we expect? I expect REVENGE & ACTION. This part doesn't have either of them. This movie is just following the synopsis of James bond and its movie series. John wick's story is supposed to be about revenge, not playing gaming cards and deciding the winner. The action was too less and the fight choreography was extremely too poor in this part. At least the previous part has some good action sequences even though it doesn't have a story. A nice touch of a gentleman's conversation and nice cinematography. I wish they could have shown us the story of Baba Yaga instead of this cheap story running around a high table for no reason. Wasted part. Could have been a lot better."
110,"John Wick: Chapter 4 sucked. Here's why.1. The characters. Caine is not interesting. There's no way a hitman could be blind and competent at their job. Even for John Wick, a series where the main character can survive multiple gunshots, it's unrealistic. Caine did not have to be blind either. His character could have been a normal hitman and it would've been way more compelling. Plus, he's pretty flat as a person and doesn't have any personality traits. Killa was equally bad. His gimmick of being comically french fell extremely flat and he's pretty annoying. Mr Nobody served no purpose to the story as well.2. The writing. There were plot holes upon plot holes. Even for a John Wick movie it was unbelievable 'Nough said.3. The action was much worse than the other films in the series. John Wick is usually regarded as having realistic action in that the attacks and gun play the characters would do would be based in reality. This was not the case. Enemies take turns attacking John Wick and the hand to hand fight scenes were much less grounded in actual fighting techniques.4. The movie was too long. That's it.5. The beginning was pretty bad, much worse than the rest of the movie."
111,"This is the best movie of all time, nobody can ever make a movie like that, Keeyanu sir always gave the best of him like in this series, really appreciate his efforts I just love this film, we want more and more chapters of John-Wick, because I am in love with this movie lots of love and respect for entire team, the action sceans of this film looks so realistic it never feel like the film it always hits me like all is 100 percent real, I want to beg of director that please never stop directing of more chapters because we really gonna miss John-Wick, and I wish that this film should won Oscar.."
112,"One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John."
113,"Just watched the 4th installment of John Wick and what a ride. This movie can be considered the best of John Wick Franchise and rightfully so. Non-Stop action, funny lines, and awesome fight sequences. If you are a fan of John Wick universe you will definitely enjoy this one. Although it is the longest among John Wick movies but i enjoyed every moment of it. It is rare to see in movies that sequels do very good and some time better than the previous installments, but John Wick 4 nailed it. This movie is one of the best action movies i've seen in the recent years and i will definitely watch it again. 10 out of 10."
114,"It has excellent staff and excellent acting.the music and the action scenes are excellent, although the movie is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it continues perfectly fluently without getting boring. It was especially good to drift with the car and shoot the enemies and adjust the camera angle from above. I've never been to a movie a second time, but I can go to this movie a second time.this is what real action movie looks like. I wish laurence fishburne had been in the movie more it would have been better.this movie is just perfect. Like I said, the musics was excellent. Such beautiful musics suits such a beautiful movie."
115,"I gave this film 10/10 and it earned every single star. Shot in NYC, Jordan, Japan, and Paris, the film captured the beauty and timelessness of each nations' historical locations. The cinematography is the best I have seen in years. The plot emerges and presents an out for John that will release him from his life on the run. Two hours and forty five minutes later, an ending that brought tears to my eyes, including the post credits scene. There is NO WAY our guy is dead, God help me, there better be another John Wick film or we will riot.The only downside of the film is Reeves' acting. They are smart to give him a small amount of dialogue, anything beyond those few words is comical. But I, as I'm sure many others, forgive him. John is a man of few words, therefore Keanu was perfect for the role. He has always been the rare A lister that acts his heart out with minimal dialogue, and somehow pulls it off. Let that be a lesson to you kids, if you have charisma but sound like a teenage stoner, you too can succeed."
116,"Overall story is good but the foundation was not that good as the previous franchises. Also in some scenes john wicks facial expressions were lacking. He worked hard to make this character as rugged as he possibly can; (with his stunts and fighting style) but some fightings scenes are soo long that it really bored some viewers. Story is good and its a 2.40 hrs long movie and i think it worth it but some unrealistic scene are made people yawn. Donny yein played his character very well but this is not possible that a blind man can fight in such a effective way, that was little too much. Although he already revealed that in a interview but somewhere it felt like his character was not properly utilised. Overall its an average movie, i mostly like the cinematography, editing, costume, action and every other small thing and its worth one time watching in a big screen."
117,"It is probably the best John Wick movie ever. Everything is almost on point. The director knows what people want to watch. The martial arts are so good to watch and are beautifully choreographed. All the casts played along with Wick. They did add the meaning to the movie. Less talk, more action. Something that I like from an action movie.Been waiting this movie for a while. Can't wait to see the prequels. A must movie in March. You will not regret every minute you spend to watch this movie.Freedom is something everyone may want to have in this life regardless of the efforts to achieve it. 😃"
118,"It's almost unbelievable how this franchise continues to top itself film after film. Just when you think you've seen everything there is to do with action, John Wick: Chapter 4 comes along and flips the entire genre on its head. This is an emotional, propulsive classic that more than justifies its epic runtime.The set pieces are bigger and better than you've ever seen. It's incredible how much innovative action Stahelski can still conjure up. This series continues its rich tradition of exceptional lore and world building. Combined with some truly beautiful imagery and balletic fight scenes, this fourth film is a joy to behold. No action film utilizes color and atmosphere quite like John Wick, as scene after scene looks like it could be a painting in the Louvre. This legendary film franchise reaches its grand conclusion in epic fashion. It's genuinely sad to see this iconic series come to an end. Or does it?"
119,"From the fight scenes, to the understated humor to the visual effects, this movie has outdone its predecessors. I didn't think it was possible, but they did.An overview continuous shot of fighting is a masterpiece. The Paris traffic car shoot out will blow your mind! I'll never look at climbing stairs the same way again ;)
There is so much action packed into (almost) 3 hours, you'll be astounded.Go SEE this!This movie not only builds on the plot, it builds on the fight scenes and the visualization.If you've been following John from the beginning, you will NOT be disappointed.Don't make the mistake of thinking there's no way they can top themselves, they can, and they did!Be seeing you..."
120,"If you have already seen the earlier installments of John Wick franchise, you are already aware of what's coming. While the JW4 trailer do showcase the level of action you're about to see, but some of the best action scenes are not in the trailer, so you have a lot to discover as you go on a ride with John Wick on his quest to challenge the High Table.While most people are talking about the insane level of action, let me tell you the two other factors that made this movie a cinematic treat to watch.Lighting - Most of the movie scenes are shot at night and they are done beautifully. The neon lights contrast with the dark sky and ultra-black suits and guns and pistols and armours. It creates a new dimension of its own.Camera Work - The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is so immersive. Just after the Paris car scene is over and when John enters a building, pay attention to how the camera moves from the moment John is on the stairs. That scene alone with a spectacular one long-shot camera work is gonna blow you apart.Watch John Wick 4 in IMAX for the best experience."
121,"After so many unnecessary movies and series that flattered all segments that did everything for the sake of being watched, you really came out very good. THX!!!It was really exciting I didn't understand when the 2.50 hours had passed, a few scenes were really, really exciting,
I'm tired of making movies just for those segments where things are really constantly shown, it feels so good to watch a real action movie.Some of the actors come across characters that we never expected and do their job successfully, giving unexpected performances.I left the hall with a smile on my face and in a fun way, thanks to everyone who contributed to this film."
122,"I really don't understand how this movie garnered such a high score. I felt like I was in a Star Wars sequel with people either running or being shot at for almost 3 hours. Cinematography was fabulous and it did take you to other countries in a realistic and enjoyable way, however, so if you could sit back and enjoy that, it was worth it.I believe Keanu Reeves' immortality outperformed Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series after being shot about 84 times, thrown down flights of stairs multiple times and off buildings - and no - the Kevlar suit wasn't convincing to me.Whereas blind people can do amazing things, Reeves' love-hate relationship with a former friend was not convincing.In college, I learned that fiction still works if it is at least somewhat believable in its own setting. This one missed the mark."
123,"It was well shot and Choreographed. Action was fine... and then it got tiresome... and then it got boring and repetitive.Basically, you're just checking your watch to realize there's still an hour of this movie left. While fans eat this up, passive viewers are checking out. There was do much time that could have been edited out, but the director had to make sure every step was on camera. Literally, there are moments where you have nothing of value put on screen for no necessary reason. Do we seriously need to see him walk the entire distance to the candles, light a candle, and walk all the way to his seat? Do we need the extra hour of random assassins just to pretend he'll be stopped?You gotta be crazy to call this the best action film. It's okay, but too self indulgent and overlong to watch again. Can directors please stop making movies over 2.5 hrs long?Spoilers:John wick kills hundreds, gets to a duel, gets mortally wounded, and kills the big bad. He wins everything, and dues on steps. Every action scene is him turning corners. Shooting guys, stabbing those close to him, reloading, and doing it again.If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same as the last three movies sans the loss of his dog in the first (the only good one)."
124,"BABA YAGA IS GOD,
PARDON ME,
GOD IS BABA YAGA""
Never watched previous installment of John Wick although the character catches your eyes at very instant as appear on the screen, the story couldn't be better if the characters didn't give justice to their part all in all a MUST watch Movie. The German Sphered has stand alone performance along with Keanu Reeves,
Donie Yen, Scott Adkins, Bill Skarsgård, Ian Macshan, Lauren Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada. The initial fight sequence in Japan was best continue shot I have ever seen in action movies. The Ending will bring out yours tears. One thing everyone should accept John Wick is a loving husband and is not dead yet."""
125,"It's nothing but overstylised overdone action sequences and comical characters, I walked out of the cinema I could not bear to waste a moment more of my time on this utter crap. I have never walked out a a cinema mid film before, and I love the cinema, so that should be a warning to anyone even considering watching this file - JUST DON'T. "" To the extent that Wick's vehicles follow the same schematic as musicals, with shootouts taking the place of song-and-dance numbers, the script doesn't have to do much more than usher the characters from one showstopper to the next."" It you must watch this film, wait for it to come to the or streaming, don't waste any of your money on this and I'd say don't wait a second of your time either!"
126,"While there is tons of style and brilliantly staged fight scenes, the first two hours drags on - it's either fight scenes we've seen in past JW movies, or hideously long exposition scenes that feel like they're going in slow motion.It's the final act that really shines, showing some new fight locations and choreography, setting a new high bar for action scenes and cinematography. While there is quite a bit of CGI enhancement, it doesn't detract from the live action which feels very fresh and visceral.It's a shame that the JW movies are getting longer, since the extra runtime in subsequent movies has not added any depth or more excitement than the first - more is not necessarily better."
127,The first John Wick movie made something really special. They introduce us a semi-realistic action movie as a genre. Unfortunately they set the bar too high and with every movie things have gotten worse. I am deeply sorry to watch this movie to get Marvelised. A frickin blind dude who just happens to see everything? The staircase scene? Are you kidding me? Yeah yeah we are about to kill each other but first let me save your dog from the bad guys? Lets just make the dog pee over the bad dudes corpse with cheesey one liner? It had some great scenes but at this point this isnt a John Wick movie. It is like a bad parody of it from Marvel.
128,"The John Wick movies have run out of ideas and just rehash the other movies. Keanu is still stiff and half asleep throughout the movie and luckily they give him very little dialogue. The other actors are superb especially Donnie Yen, who is an actual martial artist. He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high. It seems like the director enjoys the same backgrounds.....church, falling down lots of steps, dance hall where everyone keeps dancing even though there is gunfire.It lacks the humor of the Taken movies and great acting in the Equalizer."
129,"Movie starts and takes a little bit time build up & then skyrockets the action sequences set the bar high x1,000 for any upcoming movies like by far one of the ""Best Action Movies Ever Made"" the whole Osaka fight, one take room gun fire sequences, everything is just ""Keanu Reeves as usual again his best more next level"" & ""Donnie Yen as Caine nailed it"" everything with a proper good story was excepting more but it is fine & when you thought it can't get more crazier then comes whole bike & car sequences it is meant for big screens biggest possible for you & then whole climax John Wick & Caine together wish they already announce Chapter 5 & movie contains credit at the very end so don't go just watch it people it will be a an experience."
130,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe It was a mistake to bingewatch the three previous movies beforhand. But my two friends and myself are unanimous after watching the movie durong a premiere : it was BAD. I mean, REALLY BAD.SPOILERS ALERT.Where do I begin. The movie starts with a plan in a dark room with Keanu hitting some board to train himself and Morpheus, euh I mean Laurence Fishburne's Hobo King character telling him it's time. And then... we almost didn't see him for the rest of the movie. It doesn't make any sense since he was the main ally John Wick could count on at the end of the third movie. In fact, nothing makes sense in this movie afterwards !Right after, he's teleported in the desert, chasing guys on horse, and he kills the wiseman just like that. Why ? There are so many characters there that doesn't have any purpose in the story, like the mercenary and his dog. Same for the Father and his daughter in Japan. John Wick travels all over the world but we don't even know why.The main antagonist... oh my god. Take all the clichés you can find on the french aristocracy and put it in one guy, and you got this movie's villain. Onlike any other villain of the franchise, he's not even scared a little bit of John Wick, not until the very end... when he choses a blind guy to do a pistol dual with John. Yeah right !Almost everything that made the previous movies so good is thrown away : the lights and colors, the rythm, the scared villains, the original choregraphies of the fights, etc. Another element that is lacking : John Wick's pain. This time, he doesn't look tough and resilient, with sheer will and tenacity. He just look stupididly invincible and invulnerable. He can get it by a car 5 times, fall from 5 stories, or from 222 stairs... no problem at all ! He's not even slightly injured. It's just ridiculous !At some point, people in the theater were laughing and it was clearly not supposed to. My friend fell asleep and I was looking at my watch. Oh and if you know Paris, you realize the traject he follows is absurd.I don't know if it's a coincidence but it seems that they changed the scenarists for this last installment. I've also read that the original version before cut had a near 4 hour lenght. Maybe we got here a part of the explanation.... sorry Keanu."
131,"I am a great fan of the first John Wick movie. A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.----------------------------This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat. Also the cinematography and music is really nice."
132,"There is art in everything and in JW4 it's the ballet of violence. From the get go, the movie unleashes artfully choreographed violence that involves weapons, martial arts and just pure raw hand to hand combat.Ideologically, I am against violence but I saw this as art, a form of expression and when I saw it like that, it just felt like I was watching a dance performance. It just happens to be violence in this case. Keanu reeves is excellent, a little older but smooth and has given a 100% to every scene.The movie runs quickly without wasting too much time on building narrative, most of it is simple, clear and precise. Is it realistic? NO, but you did come to watch JW4 so just enjoy the ride."
133,"To many poor decisions. John Wick the indestructible man versus daredevil.... No sense of peril, no consequences.... Everyone has bullet proof suits, but not one of the countless disposable useless henchmen thinks to maybe aim for the head?? I get it's a movie and get John Wick is a man of focus..... But walks away from getting hit by so many cars I lost count, literally falling out of buildings... But then dies from a mere stomach wound....... Loved the first two, was just about ok with the third, but this one was too far for me to stretch I am afraid. Just cant understand all the rave reviews..."
134,"I wanted to like this movie so badly. The first three were great, albeit gradually declining in quality throughout the series. I was excited and hopeful for the fourth installment but couldn't have been let down more. The action was boring by mid film and there was still another hour and a half to go at that point. This movie is ten minutes shy of three hours long. The fight scenes go on way longer than they need to, moves are repeated over and over and the plot armor of JW becomes laughable. If you like the film because John is a regular guy with crazy skills, you'll hate this. If you see him as some kind of superhero then you'll probably enjoy it. The guy legit falls out of 5 story buildings onto stone roadways and just rolls over and gets up. It felt insulting to my intelligence."
135,"A bullet ballet with lots of overly long action scenes full of complex fight choreography. It looks and plays out just like a videogame - the protagonist defeats an overwhelming number of enemies, shrugs off damage like it is nothing and bystanders either don't exist or act oblivious to the ensuing violence. The setting always required a suspension of belief and realism, but this one with its bullet proof suits and vehicle fight scene was ridiculous. The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around. Some sequences were entertaining, the support cast and their fluid alliances was good, the ending was rather fitting and although a long film, it didn't feel it."
136,"In a word, terrible. No plot, no two scenes flowed, new characters had little to offer, Mr Nobody offered nothing to the plot and was a pointless character, Reeves was as wooden as a tree, action scenes seemed to last for 30 minutes each, Skarsgard with a Swedish accent for a French character, the list goes on. Apparently, the plot is that the 'High Table come for John', but it felt like the plot was just for John Wick to rack up a higher kill count than Topper Harley (which is 389 by the way).Then there's the injury continuity:-
Bad guy gets hit by a car-dead
John Wick gets hit by a car-nothing
Bad guy falls off the edge-dead
John Wick falls from a 3 story building onto the roof of a van-nothing.3 hours of my life that I won't get back. Don't even bother with the DVD/release on Sky, just avoid it."
137,"This movie is going to be like Die Hard in how a lot of action movies from here on will copy it in some way. The acting in this is so good, but wow oh wow big shout out to the stunt team. There were times I lost my breath. I had my eyes on the screen and didn't blink. At times I felt like I was on a roller-coaster or the adrenaline you get playing basketball. I hope they make more because they're so much fun, but if it is the last that's a helluva way to go. Hands down the best action movie I've ever seen. People bouncing off cars, flying through the air I mean it's AWESOMEEEEEEE!I felt like how I felt after a close game when I played football in high school when I left the theater."
138,"Seriously loved this one and already looking forward to watching it again. The action scenes were brilliant, and I won't spoil it but there was one scene that took my breath away with the way it was filmed. Kudos to the director, actors, stuntman and all involved in this movie. It lived up to the franchise and is my second favorite after the original.The plot was simple, and the foreshadowing a bit heavy, but all around an awesome action movie and so fun to watch. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next action sequence, the nearly 3 hours passed by much faster than I was expecting. Really great movie and a must see!"
139,"After a drop off in story quality a bit with parts 2 and 3, John Wick is doing what he does best - building up a huge body count.A totally coherent plot is not necessary for these. However it is nice to see a modicum of effort involved. Our story here will not win any awards, but it's just a series of flimsy excuses to have endless fight scenes play out. Lots of ammunition is expended, lots of people are kicked, thrown around and punched. And if you enjoy seeing people meeting an unfortunate encounter with a vehicle (moving or stationary), you will not be disappointed.All the John Wick films have a 1990's era Homg Kong action movie vibe. Other than maybe the first, this one captures that feel the best of the bunch."
140,"The wait was worth it. John Wick 4 is the best of all John Wick. It has outstanding &mind blowing action scenes. Some of them you have already seen like the way John Kills with pistols but the car sequence & The fire Gun killing scenes will 100% blow your mind & the different camera angle makes it more unique! The movie is 3 hours long but Don't worry you are not gonna regret it... donnie yan the master has done amazing job, simply outstanding with his sword!! At some points you gotta feel for John. If you are a true john wick fan you'll understand the pain he's going through the whole movie.... the scene i liked the most in which john's driving car & killing bunch of peoples at the same timing, i bet you'll love it too!!!"
141,"This is hard to write. I'm a huge Keanu fan as well as the Wick character. However, this 4th installment left me wanting and at times checking the clock during the show. You have probably already read that the action and fighting is good. It is, but it's not new or innovative. Assuming you've seen the first 3? There's guns, hand to hand, cool use of the environment, lots of bullet proof clothing and ineffective hits, a dog and some of the other Wick tropes. I guess I was expecting another new style or sweet scenario. I enjoyed the movie, but was expecting a Wick experience and instead got a, 'quest for more money' type of vibe where the scenes and situations seemed repetitive. I suggest seeing the flick, just temper your expectations and hope they don't unequivocally jump the shark on a 5th. Wick is great, but it's not a franchise to simply repeat and this installment feels like the beginning of that."
142,"Keanu Reeves is my idol & he was made for this movie , bow down to the best action movie I have ever watched , the best
from beginning till end my mind just blown away , cinematography with pure gangster music is something else to witness it.Best John wick movie ,
Pure action
Pure acting
Pure badass character
Pure heart from inside but can burn anyone whoever steps forward to hurt his one's ,
In the end I just want to say that thank you Keanu for delivering such badasss movie , now times Hollywood cinema downgraded a little bit but actor like you & Tom cruise bring back the Hollywood to its pure class ,"
143,".......except the plot is even more predictable. 80% of the same O gun fight scenes. How many times can you do the same thing, so boring and repetitive? I get it, all gun and no plot is its genre but at least hire some decent writers. Barely any new action or gun scenes. The producers are just milking this cash cow dry to the bone. This movie was 1hr toooooo long also. The only good thing was the music had good bass and fit the scenes and only if you watched in Dolby with the vibration seats........except the plot is even more predictable. 80% of the same O gun fight scenes. How many times can you do the same thing, so boring and repetitive? I get it, all gun and no plot is its genre but at least hire some decent writers. Barely any new action or gun scenes. The producers are just milking this cash cow dry to the bone. This movie was 1hr toooooo long also. The only good thing was the music had good bass and fit the scenes and only if you watched in Dolby with the vibration seats."
144,"If you love previous John Wicks and have seen the reviews of this one and are excited to see this be prepared to be very dissapointed, this is not only the worst John Wick movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life, this movie had no storyline but it was filled just with fightin scenes that were absudly long and exagerated more than in a superhero movie ( batman, superman ). Characters were like if they were written by a 10 year old and werent interesting at all, scenes were made Ok and cinematography was on point, storyline was the worst, movies was so long so slow and you would know how it ended before even a scene began. I dont know how this movies got this high rating 8.8/10, I wont trust these ratings anymore."
145,"You already know how it is. Four movies, roughly 10 hours of watching people die and somehow it all lead up to this. Incredible world building, compounded by brilliant choreography, acting and script writing.Every scene looks hyper real. Every gun shot, every punch, it's an art form. John Wick 4 neatly wraps up and incredible journey I didn't expect to go on. But I'm greatful I did.It's the Die Hard of my generation and it's learned and matured so well. It's a visual spectical and I could watch it again and again. For me its a great start to cinema in 2023. It's got me excited for the next films I intend to see (Openheiner and MI).Go see this movie and don't make the mistake I did, stay for the final scene after the credits!"
146,"First one was good, 2nd was better and really good. Third was the best, so I thought, it's going the right direction.. I couldn't be more wrong.. First of all, what made the previous movies so great and especially the third one, was the details in the action scenes were so accurate.. All of the sudden in the beginning of the hotel in Japan, John wick kept shooting without reload, until he was alone there doing the shooting..? At the end as well.. 21 bullets in his gun. It seemed more.. Also again in so many movies lately, why exagérating so much and making scenes so long, especially during some dialogues.. You know what they're gonna say or what's coming.. And when he fell down the stairs at the end. That was so over the top and unnecessary and so unrealistic.. He had 8 minutes to climb those 222 steps or so, whilst kicking everybody's ass. 3 minutes to go and down he goes all the way to the bottom and start over, crawl back up, little dialogue with Donnie y'en and make it both in time..?? The director said he had to make movie this long to tell the story. That's not true at all. Story wise, it had no positive effect. He just put in more and longer action scenes.. Total let down when you compare it the previous movies. And very predictable also at some times.. This movie wasnt worth waiting so long and definetly not my money.."
147,"Now thats how you make the final chapter. Paced perfectly, shot stunningly and acted beautifully! Builds up on the strengths of John Wick 1 and John Wick 2 and fixes the flaws of John Wick 3. I really hope they keep this as the end of the franchise because the conclusion is just flawless where chapter 4 ties up everything together giving due justice to all its characters. Kudos to the director for coming up with this gem of a movie and the stunt crew for the out of this world stunt scenes and thank you Keanu Reeves for being Keanu Reeves. You have taken gun fighting and close combat action genre to another level!!"
148,"For years during action movies I've just wanted more action i.e. The transformers franchise and many others. John Wick 4 takes action movies to a whole new level. This movie is 3/4 action and its some of the best fighting and visuals I've ever witnessed in any movie. While a lot of it will have you saying to yourself, ""there's no way he survives this"", you quickly will remember that's part of the lore of the John Wick movies and you don't care anymore. Very solid movie and a hell of a way to end the franchise if they so choose (Hope they don't). My only dislike is the main enemy of this movie didn't get the violent and punishing death that he deserved, however it was satisfying when he did eat that bullet."
149,"Let me start this off saying that I am a huge fan of this franchise. The first two movies are some of my favorite of all time. The third disappointed me story wise, but the action was incredible. This movie for me was the worst of the 4.This movie is long yes, but that's not my main problem with the film. Obviously you need to suspend disbelief in these movies but the blind character was a step too far. I do not understand how this guy is shooting people, dodging bullets and not getting shot himself. The movie is also poorly acted, the worst in the franchise in my opinion.I did not love the story either, the plot line with poker and the man who killed his uncle was insanely weird and poorly done. This world that we have experienced in the last movies has changed so dramatically. Overall heavily disappointed but there was some great action scenes. Also SPOILER:::John wicks death was well done. A little abrupt but it was time."
150,"The way part 3 left off, fans knew more was coming, and the waited chapter 4 does not disappoint, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is still trying to end him from being hunted and in hopes to finally find peace, by going to the highest power, but getting there won't be easy.Man the action almost never stopes, pretty much there is little time to breath, but that has always been the joy of this series. Keanu Reeves is always at his best here. But everybody here does shine in there own way, even two characters I believe that derserve there own spin off, you'll know them when you see them. I don't want to tell you anymore, but I'll say 4th time is the charm."
151,"Go to the bathroom before the movie because if you leave during you ""will"" miss something for sure.. Its John Wick on Steroids!!! And when you think you know what's happening next(other than another few hundred deaths) it takes a turn, again and again. Lots of stories inside the main story. Keanu is well great. And all the characters are there along with the whole host of new characters that spice up the stories, inside the story. There are some chuckles when you need them the most so you can exhale and take a fresh breath scattered throughout the film. Oh yea stay until the end of the credits!! Enjoy."
152,"My ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" SPOILER Review:PROS:-This is PEAK Keanu. He was born for this role!-The Osaka Sequence is God-Tier!-Donnie Yen is the definition of cool!-The Birdseye view sequence covering an entire floor of a building during a shoot out!-The Flight of Stairs Sequence!-The Cinematography is amazing! All the colors pop!-The Pacing and Editing. Doesn't feel it's run time at all!-The Duel Sequence!-The Ending. Unexpected and Perfect!CONS:-It had to end.This is the Apex Mountain of Modern Day Action Movies. These films have been an unexpected surprise and the people behind it have gone above and beyond, perfecting their craft along the way, to entertain the audience! In a world dominated by CGI Blockbusters, the John Wick films have been a breath of fresh air, relying on beautifully crafted stunt choreography, fantastic direction, and actors that came to play and who knew exactly what kind of films they were making. Chapter 4 took everything from the first 3 films and amplified it. I don't wanna spoiler anything here, as this deserves to be experienced first hand. Keanu Reeves was born to play this character and this is his best outing as the character yet! I can't say enough positive things about this film. Pure Action Escapism. 9/10."
153,"One of the most tedious, overly long drawn out self aggrandising pieces of drivel I have ever had the misfortune to sit through.Constant repetition during fight scenes that add nothing the whole film could've been just over an hour long and would've been much better because of it.I really really loved the first three films that this is the chapter four that they thought we wanted is unreal.And such miss use of Lance Reddick in one of his last ever roles.The only good thing to come out of this film is, I don't think there be any more of them.They should have called it, John Wick and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
154,"I'm gonna have to rewatch this one another day. But I found myself beginning to doze off repeatedly like an hour 1/2 into the movie. I can't quite put my finger on it. The villain was definitely boring, the story line and dialogues seemed a bit stretched out. The fight scenes and overall feel of them didn't quite do it for me like the first 3 movies did. I think there's gonna be mixed reviews on this one. I felt there were several plot holes. And I'm in limbo about how I feel about the ending. It seemed fitting but then also didn't...? Lol. Idk man I just think some lazy writing went into play on this one."
155,"This is easily the best John Wick out of all of them and one of the best action movies of the decade so far. When I saw this movie, the theater was packed and it deserved to be. There were young people, old people, men, women, white, black, all kinds of people there who loved this movie and got a thrill out of it! The John Wick franchise and Keanu Reeves literally bring people together and action like this is what we need in our movies, real stunts on camera with real effort and without needless CGI! Donnie Yen killed it in his role and there are fantastic sequences that blew me away (the stairs scene, the Paris traffic scene around the Arc De Triomphe, and the ending duel specifically). The wet night club fight and the fancy Japanese hotel scene were astounding as well, and throw in the humor and the dog as the two cherries on top. Take notes Hollywood! And huge shoutout to Keanu Reeves for doing stunts and work like this at his age still, he's just as impressive as Tom Cruise!"
156,"Just saw 4th installment of much talked and long time waited with eager and high expectations but I disappointed while watching. Last action scene is not impressive seems only for repeated for John Wick. Final climax is interested and watchable.Acting Kanu Reaves is looking aged and tired. Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburn, Issac Mc, Riddick interesting. Surprise is Scott Adkins. He is looking very different apart from his macho image. High table and it's rules are not new we already seen previously. Here only locations different and authorised persons changed.Overall movie is watchable once.It is my first movie after two and half years due to my illness."
157,"Such a bad movie. 3 hour long fight where John has put on ""godmode"". Absolutely 0 story, besides just fighting. The whole theatre bursted out laughing because of the ridiculous fightscenes. I am left so angry and annoyed. Don't you ever go watch this pile of poop if you like anything that is the slightest realistic. More unrealistic than Marvel movies. It has absoluty nothing to offer. A blind guy who can fight, shoot and play cards? What is this? Maybe 12-13 year old kids would find this movie cool. This is as stupid as it gets. John Wick says nothing in the movie. It is absolutely pointless and meaningless."
158,"In the whole John Wick movie series, this is the best in action I would say . The direction, stunts performed by Keanu Reeves is just mind blowing. Overall an action packed movie . And the perfect climax in a traditional way . Everything was just perfect. There are a lot of action movies out there but the what the action sequences in this movie are just impeccable . The collaboration of so many good actors make the movie even better. Donnie yen did a really good job playing a character of a blind contract killer . I have no regrets watching this movie on first day first show . Lastly I would say MUST WATCH!Baba yaga has its own way to make you satisfied with his action ."
159,"This is (in my opinion) the best John Wick movie in the franchise. The way they go about telling the continuation of this ""Ghost looking for his graveyard"" is phenomenal. The new characters are all extremely exciting to watch and lovable. The choreography of the action sequences is fantastic and you can easily tell how much work was put into them. The camera shots (especially one in particular) were absolutely genius and beyond what I could have expected. This movie is fantastic. Everything about it is a fantastic way to end the story of John Wick. The ending. Wow. Although sad of course, it is a happy ending. It is all we could have asked for as fans of these movies.This movie is a must see and is (IMO) the best John Wick movie they have made."
160,"Alright, so I saw John Wick 4 last night, and I feel like it's my obligation to issue a fair warning... it is not as good/perfect as the ""ratings"" want you to believe. Read the negative reviews, they have merit.Before going to see Chapter 4, I rewatched the first 3 and was totally swept off my feet, again! The 4th is a redundant, emotionless, farcical disappointment that fails to advance the story, yet alone resolve it. SO MUCH POTENTIAL after the 3rd one to witness John recover, exact revenge on his betrayers, and peel back the curtain of the high table: doesn't happen. Weak-weak-weak storyline with plot contrivances galore.There is only one action scene that stood out that is maybe the most memorable of the series... and one driving scene with some of the sickest tracking shots I've ever seen... but just be prepared to watch hours of nonsense for those 15 min of magic. But was there cool fighting throughout? Yes, but it falls flat because it is so absurdly unrealistic and tedious without any grounding sense of purpose. Not trying to deter you from seeing it. Just advising you to lower your expectations so that maybe you can enjoy it for what it is."
161,"Exactly same as the other 3 films, We expected the story to evolve and progress more, but it was just like the others, man to man. Of course, the scenes were very good filmed, very amusing and exciting, watching it in cinema was not a waste of time, but after some time, I felt we are watching same thing as happening in other movies, I don\t want to get into more details, so I don't spoil the movie. The movie definitely worth watching. Maybe I had something in mind about the way the event could evolve, but this is my personal view, my son liked it, it was good father - son time in the cinema. ."
162,"John Wick 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the saga of the legendary assassin. Keanu Reeves delivers another stellar performance as the unstoppable John Wick, who faces his most formidable foes yet in his quest for vengeance and freedom. The action sequences are breathtaking and inventive, showcasing the skills and charisma of Reeves and his co-stars, especially Donnie Yen as Caine, a blind former colleague of Wick who becomes his ally. The film also expands the mythology of the John Wick universe, introducing new characters and locations that add depth and intrigue to the story. The cinematography, music, and editing are all top-notch, creating a stylish and immersive experience for the viewers. John Wick 4 is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike. It is a rare example of a sequel that surpasses its predecessors in every aspect. I give it 5 stars out of 5."
163,"Best John Wick Movie so far. More actions in the movie. More interesting story. And mostly the last battle that's like the cowboy movie. 1v1. Men to men. So many places to get highlighted. And for god sake John Wick is frkin immortal. Enemy keep missing shots after shots. And there is Donnue Yen. One of my favorite actor. The battle music is very great. And mostly I like the part when the camera rotates like a FPS Tournament. They give you some rotating sort of effect and a top camera view. Totally like FPS tourney'and yes John Wick still love dogs. Best 2023 movie so far. But sadly it showed that Wick is dead. But hey, gotta be another movie because, Wick once faked his death (kind of). So looking forward to next part of this movie (If it's really another part)."
164,"ALL reality must be suspended for this totally unbelievable film. Can't believe I wasted and of my precious time on this trash. The fight scenes were well choreographed, however that's all the film is, just one fight after another with Reeves surviving clearly unsurvivable situations, to the point where the audience was just laughing. If it is meant to be a comedy, then it isn't that funny, it this is not a film that you can take seriously either!!Won't be watching any more Wicks films, that's for sure. Highly disappointing trip to the cinema, which in any event is rare these days, as so many films are below par."
165,This is one of the best action movies of all time hands down no competition. This installment blows all of the other movies out of the water with the action scenes and it mixes it perfectly with story telling. I would love to see them take this series forward but if this movie were to be the end of the franchise i would be content. This film has made me want to rewatch all of the other films to really get the full experience of the story as they pick up where each one left off. This movie is a must watch masterpiece of a film; john wick if he returns out of the shadows again I will certainly give that one a watch too.
166,"I was starting to get a bit tired from this franchise, despite me loving the third movie, on some rewatches, it felt like the only thing happening were action sequences, and they were still very impressive and memorable, its just that 2 and a half hours of that gets tiring at some point and I was a little afraid the same thing was going to happen here and on some degree it does, the action sequences are still very impressive and epic. But sometimes they last a little more than what they should, but this movie has much more story than its predecessors, now John Wick has more of an objective than just kill whoever tries to kill him, here, he really has a chance to be free again and with the help of other characters who also have better motivations in this one, he plans on getting it. Obviously the best thing of this movie are the fighting scenes, combined with their awesome cinematography, music and choreographys it makes for a great experience. I already talked about some some of them lasting a bit too much but that doesnt affect the film as much as it could have. And in this one, we have a more clear villain, who you hate from the first scene from which he appears, he is bad. Elegant and menacing, he is awesome. The side characters and new ones introduced are also very interesting and entertaining to watch, mainly Cain, who I hope gets a spin off or something. And all the movie is like this, the best quality of action a movie can have but stopping at the right times so it doesnt get tiring enough. And finally I want to say that the finale was the best it could have been for this saga, the tension depsite not being a fight is the greatest Ive ever felt watching these movies, you are genuinly terrified from whats about to happen, and you dont want to watch the outcome but you have to because its where everything gets defined. It is definitely, the WORTHY ENDING John Wick deserved."
167,"Okay this movie is INSANE. Insane cinematography. Insane lighting. Insane sound-design. And most of all, insane action -the good ol' gun fights, hand-to-hand combats, sword-fights, everything short of tanks and fighter planes. This is everything the previous movies were, but the duration is 2x. That said, you'll still have to give it all the cinematic liberties to enjoy it thoroughly.Keanu Reeves did exactly what you've seen him do before, nothing new, but twice as much. Special mention to Donnie Yen for the role that he was given. Rina Sawayama, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins, were GOOD additions.There may come a point where, if you're not a John Wick fan but a regular film lover, you MAY feel ""Okay, dude. Stop fighting and move on to the next thing."" But if you're a fan and enjoyed the previous ones, you'll have a ball with this movie."
168,"This movie is GREAT, the action the cinematography the music the feel..the swag of john... Everytime looks phenomenal.. I'm from India and I watch this movie first day first show.. and I must say.. it's better then any action movie I EVER watched before..a must watch movie... If you are Indian then go and grab some popcorn 🍿 and enjoy the ride of full of action & pure greatness.. #johnwick4. Note: If you never seen any john wick movies before then first watch all the movies on OTT then go for this f*king great movie.. and if you like it then go celebrate the thirll you feel while watching this blockbuster movie 🍿"
169,"Beautiful cinematic experience, intense action sequences and great characters that made the movie memorable. John Wick concludes it's chapter by seeing how pissed off John is. The only way to freedom is a old traditional duel. However John must get past a thousand men army and fight his way to freedom in time or he will be executed. John is amazing, Donnie Yen, Tracker, and Marquis are great enemies of John Wick. All are motivated by their own personal interests.The movie was 2 hours and 49 minutes. I was so intrigued with the movie I had no idea how much time passed. It had the right elements and I was intrigued by every scene. Thank you for making this series a great experience! It was fun."
170,"Best movie in the franchise imo, it's an action movie but it seems more than that, the atmosphere makes it look like a piece of art, beautiful photography. Amazing stunts done by Keanu Reeves that I consider one of the best action actors, Bill Skarsgård is good but there is something in there that makes me feel weird, good characters. Amazing sequences of action with some sequence shots that are absolutely fabulous. Good story, well developed. Some bad dialogues, some towards the end when it tries to be very epic and dramatic, it is but more when it does not try to be. Good ending to John Wick."
171,"Seriously?!?! 4 years for this? That was pitiful!I don't understand the 10/10 or the 9/10 or really anything past a 6. Perhaps my hopes were far to high from watching the other 3 but wow I was let down and in so, so many ways. My dissatisfaction is absolutely raging. Where was the blood thirst?! Where was the rage?! Where was THE John Wick?!Now, we talk about the ending.What happened John? The other guy had the same wounds as you did and you died, or did you ""die""? Either way coming out of that movie theater I felt like something was missing and I've come to the conclusion that a lot is missing. Now I'm sad and filled with frustration and not just at the outcome of the movie, but how long I waited for the movie."
172,"This movie is phenomenal. Keanu's best acting in my personal opinion. So much words of wisdom said and yet so much actions done at the same time. It's a realistic movie, not just your typical action film. John Wick is a man of reason. There are a few comedic banters in the film that just make it so much better. I'm usually the type to not finish a movie in one sitting. I easily get carried away or bored, but this masterpiece right here kept me entertained for three hours straight. I was laughing, I was scared, I was weeping, and I was serious. So many emotions for one great film. I rarely give 10 star reviews but this one deserves it most. You know it's a 10/10 if you're willing to watch it over and over and over again, and still love it every single time. Amazing film! Highly recommend watching! Great end to the series! Also Bill Skarsgard is incredible in this film, do watch it, no regrets at all I swear."
173,"Who doesn't like a good revenge movie?JW1 was fantastic
JW2 equally
JW3 left you hanging but
JW4.......
Problem here started with the very first 'battle' scene. Went for ages - Usually a good thing however each engagement was the same as before, hence 'Rinse and Repeat'.Don't start me on the 'Roundabout scene'.Good escapism but so repetitive that an almost full Cinema were left with nothing to say at the end.On a plus, the cinematography was ingenious in parts and a recurring reference to an Australian Bushranger was clever.Watch it because you watched the other 3, but don't expect Prose...
It would be interesting to know Keanu's word count!"
174,"The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in any movie holding up to films like blade runner and interstellar. The choreography is even better than the previous 3 films. The acting is even superb despite the other films lacking in that category, I was actually emotionally invested in this story more than I usually am during a movie and I walked away dumbfounded by it's surprising excellence. I would not have expected an action movie from a series known for being over the top and goofy to be such an incredibly well done movie, but it was. That being said, the film still manages to be quite funny and whimsical at times and is still over the top like John wick should be."
175,"I really can't understand how many people thinks its the best ever.Its not. It was great until arrive to Arc de Triumphe, after this all scenes were way exagerated, he is not a robot, we could never take what he did, while others keep falling of very light hits.The fall on top of the car and all the stairs scene, competely ridiculous.In previous movies he killed with two shot (chest and head), now lots of times, in guys without armor, lots of shots completely unecessary.The blind guy completely ridiculous, its not a Marvel movie with guys with super powers.As an additional stpe, no way the Table would allow to any of the duel fighters to be touched before getting there, otherwise also John could kill that very poor marquis. No sense at all.Its a pitty, nice fighting scenes.And the end, COME ON!!!Baba Yaga never dies, it disapperas into the mist, until he's needed again.By far the worst."
176,"I walked out of theater for a film with so many hype and so many fake fans they know john wick if your happy with the ending fine with him dying your not a real fan unless you thinke he survived.John Wick the man the myth the legend dies from a gunshot wound exactly where the doctor in 3rd got shot. Rambo got shot in the same shoulder he surivived the doctor survived. Not John Wick hereis the thing about action movie hero they are not supposed to die they are supposed to live. John Wick he died for nothing he dident take down the hightable his friend Donnie Yen probaly going to kill the friend he sacraficed his life for. Johns life is for nothing who did he save the trailers made us think he will take down the high table we could have had endgame moment where thousands of assasins fighting armys of high table forces. They killed of Charon which is bad because his death was for nothing. End of the day we havent even seen who is the true head of the High Table we got another villian like the ajudicator whose roles mean nothing. Not just the terrible ending the action is rushed. One and two the action was more slower and more focused. They are doing these fast shots if they making a pg 13 movie. Donnie Yen is not utilaized he is know for hand to hand not a gun and knife. 5 was supposed to be filmed at the same time as 4 canceled that plan because of covid are you telling me John true bad guy is covid 19. The thing I am worried about is that they will replace Joh n Wick with Ana De Armas or the new girl Akira if thats the case why is everything killing of male charachters with female nobody wants a MSHEU. This can be fixed bring Keanu Reeves back I will give this a 6 out of 10 do not come with the excuses he is old Tom Cruise is older and he going to keep doing stunts until he dies. This is not how a man , myth the legend is suppoded to die he is Baba Yaga not some cry baby who died after a shot to the shoulder. Watch this at home if your desperate to see it."
177,"This was my most anticipated movie of 2023, & John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) both lived up & exceed all of my expectations. John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is not only the best movie of 2023, not only is it the best movie of the John Wick Franchise, but it is one of the greatest Action Movies of all time & is possibly the greatest movie that Keanu Reeves has ever done in his career.The action & violence is outstandingly phenomenal! There are so many phenomenal standout action scenes, that I can't name all of them. One of my favorite scenes is where they are paying homage to Cowboy Bebop.So if I didn't sell you enough with those statements, John Wick; Chapter 4 (2023) is a masterpiece of the action genre. It is the best movie of 2023 & I believe that no movie will even come close to besting it for the rest of the year!"
178,"Feels like a high production fan fiction, or perhaps someone from the High Table (if you know what I mean) sampled the social media and compiled fan's favorite bits into this mishmash of a movie.Very little rhyme or reason to it... All plot lines feel calculated and unnatural, as if it was directed by a spreadsheet (or an AI perhaps?) and not a real person.And the ending... Good grief! I can almost hear the boardroom discussing how to make this movie end in such a way that it will provoke strong social media reactions, possibly igniting sequels and spinoffs. And while at it, likely boost DVD sales due to included alternative endings....But hey, at least color grading was spectacular!"
179,"This movie ll go down in history as one of the best action movies. The Immortal Baba yaga is back to get his freedom back and ready to kill anybody coming his way. With the addition of new characters, there is no way this franchise is going to end with this film. This movie has raised the bar in all technical aspects whether it's sound design, cinematography, editing, production design. Overall, it's a must watch for action fans. Watch it in biggest screen possible with Dolby sound. The very first scene will make your heart thumping. Donnie yen excels in all the scenes he features. All characters played their part well. Just go and watch this once in lifetime experience."
180,"As a massive Wick fan I was really looking forward to this....and yet left thr cinema feeling annoyed and frustrated yet again by Hollywood's obsession with making films an hour longer than they need to be.There were some beautiful moments in the film. Some of the tight fight moves were off the chart and Reeves athleticism is incredibly impressive.The card playing scene was pure genius. The overhead cam shot scene in the old building was revolutionary and expertly choreographed. The negotiation for the specifics of the dual was wonderful too.The idea of a blind assassin was also fresh and the ultimate dual scene was very well handled.However, much of the rest was so repetitive it became not only boring to watch but irritating. Watching the same gun, knife, roll, fall etc 150 times is just pointless and boring.The penultimate scene of JW getting up the steps to the dual was painful beyond belief. I mean come on ffs!! We've watched him spend the last half hour moving a mile and kill 200 men...just get there already.JW 1 was so fresh and new its sad that we have now ended up with an hour of amazing cinema and nearly 2 hours of what looks like a kid playing a first person shooter.Maybe the US audience love this stuff but for the brits it would be nice if they could edit out about an hour of the repetitive and unbelievable nonsense as it had so much promise and yet fell so short.Usual problem of studio giving production total freedom to do what they like. Money money money over finished product."
181,"This is one of the best action movies I've ever watched and it's truly magnificent to watch. I can't believe this movie was that good and I'm so happy it was so good. I love all the new characters introduced like Caine, Mr Nobody and a lot more other characters which were super enjoyable to watch and I began to like these characters quite a ton. I feel like some people won't like the ending of this movie but I think it was super well written and a great way to the end the movie. Keanu Reeves was such a badass as John Wick yet again as he was so damn cool and great to watch in this movie. Overall this movie is quite phenomenal."
182,"Yeah yeah, yeaaahhhhhh, yeah, YEAHH, yeah, I need guns, lots of guns.Honestly I need to watch it again because all of us went to the Cinemark XD theater to watch it and it was 88 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire length of the movie. We were all sweating and felt like we were going through menopause. This made the movie seem longer and more arduous than it could have been. Great movie! Great sequels!How many sequels are this consistent, congruent, character driven, have characters with motivation, butterfly effects, fantasy, lore, escapism, a good ending and send off.We wanted Matrix sequels and we got John Wick!!!"
183,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews praising a film that reflects no appreciation for originality and authentic film making.Chapters one and two have really been closed off with a load of rubbish for the last 2. Just a money maker now. Shades of the Fast and furious franchise. Poor story line, no purpose, makes no sense and a really pointless conclusion. Rips off the warriors classic with a stupid black American radio host (in the middle of Paris) 🙈😂. Extremely poor writing.Very very poor film. Reeves could dodge bullets in the matrix, then stop them. No need for that here, as every bullet no matter how many or how close seem to miss. I would have thought a crossover with marvel might be on the cards. Considering every person seems to have Vibranium weaved into their suits. 🙈Class fight choreography, props to the stunt team. Except for the occasional henchman who stands there watching Wick kill his colleagues before lifting his gun after 5 seconds, perfect timing for a John wick reversal. Or a kick that somehow causes Wick to fall down 3 flights of stairs. Keane Reeves definitely has a career as a pro football player, the amount of rolling he does down those steps. Got a few laughs out of the crowd. 😂😂You honestly do have to be quite simple to be impressed by a movie of this quality. But ""Such is Life"" When it comes to the standard of film making now a days."
184,"John Wick did not disappoint with his action again. At least for me. In my opinion, this series is pretty safe. He can do action scenes and that's the main thing for me and I was entertained the whole movie. Add to the fighting and shooting a hilarious soundtrack and the fun was taken care of. I've heard a bit of criticism about the length, but I was fine with it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I also praise the surprise ending. I thought the fourth episode was very good. But after some thought, I'm still leaning towards the third one, which charmed me with its action a bit more than here. The locations were also great and I liked them a lot, but I will mention the third part again, which appealed to me more with its setting. I don't have much to add. John Wick is a luxury action series for me and probably always will be. The action is the main thing here for me and it succeeded this time and once again I praise the surprise ending. For me, a great film that I recommend to fans of the series or action genre enthusiasts."
185,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lover's wet dream. The cinematography is Oscar-worthy, and the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colors make each scene pop. The action choreography utilizes 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knives, nun chucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stunt work is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, especially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the movie. It's pure gold."""
186,"Honestly, I feel like the title to this review is enough. The fight scenes in this movie are the best they possibly could be. These are the kinds of stunts where I could see Tom Cruise watching this film in theaters and going, ""Challenge accepted.""
The best word that comes to mind to describe the first few action set pieces is: ""beautiful."" I realize that what was happening on screen was very violent, but the movements and the methodical timing of them reminded me of an intricate dance, and I mean that in the highest of praise.I feel like the word masterpiece gets tossed around a lot, but this movie is a masterpiece. I believe this will become the action movie to beat for a while."
187,"Wow. What can I say! I'd been looking forward to this since the last one came out and I wasn't disappointed. Flat out action from start to finish. The acting from everyone is phenomenal and Donnie Yen is on another level for me. Bill Skarsgård is also a fantastic actor and his turn as Marchese de Gran just shows yet again how much talent he has. I remember the first John Wick coming out and at the time, we knew nothing about it. By the end, we were blown away. I got the same feeling all over again last night. The fight scene choreography is very real and done very well. As always, Ian McShane puts in a stellar performance and the way he says 'Jonathan', just takes me to the fair lol. A movie that I'll happily watch in the cinema again and enjoy every minute of."
188,"John Wick 44 because once you have seen one, all the rest are pretty much the same. It's sad that this is all Hollywood can come up with. I suppose if you check your brain at the door, you can sit back and enjoy it. But the idea that someone - who isn't a ""superhero"" can endure beatings, gunshots, and getting run over by cars - without missing a beat - is a little too ridiculous for me. The several hundred thugs who are sacrificed are much the same, until the inevitable head shot. I'd say this review contains spoilers, but if you've seen any of the John Wick movies, nothing written here should come as any surprise."
189,"If you love John Wick, you will love this film. This is a beautiful and appropriate end to the best action movie series of all time. John Wick 4, like 1-3 before it, is pure entertainment.Everything in this movie not only ""works"", but it wraps up one hell of a four-film ride. From the opening scene to the closing credits, John Wick 4 met and exceeded all my expectations. That was no small task - not because my expectations matter (they don't), but because this movie had to tie up a lengthy, complex, and ever-growing story in a way that honores the quality of the first three films while doing what each John Wick film does best, making a unique story fit perfectly within a broader movie universe.I can't promise you will love this movie as much as I do, but I can promise, if you are a fan of John Wick, you will absolutely love this film and you won't spend $16 any better way than buying a ticket to see this masterpiece. Go watch it!!"
190,"This really is a 4th chapter. 4x action, 4x dialogues, 4x visuals and stunts are literally amazing.I wanted a bit more ""involved"" story. It is simple continuation of the last chapter but some ""tweaks"" needed. Yes, the last scene will shock you for sure but without it you will need to want more.Yes of course, whatever shown in the first 3 episodes are summarised and when John is dying in the last scene that won't make you cry but will make you want him more and a sence of relief that he is now free from all the BS he faced.So overall it is a good movie, I would love it more if the fighting scenes were taken in a different way than they did in the last 3 chapters. Some new angles, slow and closeup scenes etc will make it a lit."
191,"The first 3 movies were fun. This one is so very bad and boring. I can not believe the rating is so high. None of the first 3 movies deserved 10 but this one was so bad. Wasn not fun, was not exciting, was not deep. It was nothing. I still have to write 350 characters but honestly there is nothing else to say. John wick 4 is a bad boring movie l. And I really hope this was the last one. There is obviously nothing else to do or show or shoot or make. Keanu is a super nice guy and I like him so I hope the movie will make enough cash. But it beyond my understanding how could some many people give it 10 points!"
192,"An evening at a local independent cinema to see a movie is rarely wasted.John Wick 4 is a bit silly, but then again so were Chapters 3 and 2..
The familiar faces of Ian McShane (replete with the 2nd worst false teeth in the movie) and Laurence Fishbourne as well as Donnie Yen , Hiroyuki Sanada and the late lamented Lance Reddick all turn up for the mayhem.With Bill Skaarsgard playing the villainous Marquis you have someone specific to root against.It's enjoyable hokum, though most of the set piece fight scenes do go on for longer than they need to, but fortunately there are enough character beats between the bullets, knives and swords to actually make you care just a little about who wins."
193,You just cant get enough of john wicks fighting realism....i just got exhausted just looking at the movie...when he fights in the round about in paris... he used moving cars as weapons...when he fights with nun chucks it wasnt the bruce lee way it was the logical way that he used them....like a baseball bat cut in half with chains..lol....this guy is always thinking and that.is why he survive so many attacks...never afraid to die but doesnt want to until his task is achieved.....REVENGE.......keanu is a new kind of action hero a true mma fighter with the heart of a lion....so all that being said this is why i gave this movie a ten it make the matrix look like a after school special with it came to the fight scenes...to me this is close to real fighting in a movie as its gonna get...and by the way this is the best one hands down.
194,"It seems like the movie only can make many noise to attract people's attention
The story begins at nowhere
And of course it ends at nowhereThe fighting part is a little bit boring
NPCs wait for a long time to let the main actor kill them
To be honest
The suits of the NPCs are quite nice
But to be honest
The sound is goodHowever The music part is awful
When it use a piece of Chopin's No.20
The music has been swiped into pieces
The violin was all wrong, even the move can't match the back sound
Make me to lost concentrate on the movieThe move and the music is totally different
I suppose at least find someone who can actually play violin
It's not a hard job."
195,"The John wick saga has found a way to entertain while keeping things simple. The story line to date isn't overly engaging or riveting and that is why they're great and thats why they work. John wick has found a way to offer the action film fan, endless gore and viloance without some BS effort to be overly clever. The 4th instalment offers more of the same, but bigger and better. It can be cringy in parts but who really cares, the amazing fight scenes more than make up for it. I think if you loved the first films you will also love this one. Not sure what's in store for the future of John Wick.....as I've said already, hopefully more of the same."
196,Although it's a decent movie but far from a reality that a man in his 40 can have so much stemina to fight almost every single man on his way to freedom. Maybe he was on Redbull all the time. He was missing shots in the clear desert area but was accurate when it comes to a crowded club. Apart from him no one was capable to shoot accurately the whole time like a bollywood movie. Hand to hand fighting scenes are repeated. After leaving the theater I didn't feel anything for the movie. Director seemed to be racist as he shown all the whites were enemies for wick and at the End a Chinese guy and two black guys on his sidewould say it's decent remake of any advanced video game.
197,"This is the movie I have waited for long and it didn't disappoint me. I think this movie is better than all john wick movies and some action movies, how it is better? This movie is funny than all previous john wick movies and action scenes is amazing (Cinematic,Production etc. Is also great). For sure this is a great movie but it is not good enough. Some scenes such as the Shimazu dying scene is not sad as the scene intended, because, this movie is a lot more action scene that make the story progression slower and make the movie longer and make it a little bit boring. [(8/10) my eng is bad lol)"
198,"Unnecessarily prolonged scenes end with a fire to the head and classic tai chi exercises performed earlier...Unoriginal villains. Constantly repeated scenes and a sense of belonging that can't get the audience into the story in any way. One of the most mediocre films not only in the series, but also for the action genre.There's no franchise more scrappy and likable than the John Wick movies of the last decade. The first film, 2014's John Wick, was a low-budget affair, helmed by an unproven director, stuntman Chad Stahelski, and starring a then-unbankable Keanu Reeves. The movie did OK in theaters but found a more appreciative fanbase on home video."
199,"This fourth chapter adds almost nothing to the John Wick franchise, born somewhat by chance and became a cult narrative for action movie nerds without thickness. The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all..."
200,"Dude I just saw this film last night and it was absolutely phenomenal. The fight scenes were so cool especially the shotgun dragons breath scene where the camera is looking down into the building and follows Wick from above as he lays waste lol. It was a little bit dragged out though. I liked it don't get me
Wrong but I think it would've worked completely fine had it be 2hrs30mins in runtime. Some of the fight scenes give you a beat to relax then start back up. The whole Osaka Continental fight scene was so cool with the arrows. Donnie Yen is a beast too. Especially in the Osaka scene. My only gripe with the film, which I understand at Keanus age and stunts can be taxing, is him phoning in his performance. Even with the first Wick film he was more animated. Especially in his movies before then. Like look at the first matrix even and then put his performance here aside it. You'll see he had more emotion back then. Yeah you can say it's ""the character"" but even with the latest Bill and Ted as well as Matrix 4, he seemed to be phoning them in as well. So idk but regardless I would see this movie in theaters. IMAX would be best."
201,"John Wick Chapter 4 is easily the greatest action movie ever made and for me, one of the best movies ever made. Not only does it have varied, high octane, insanely choreographed and nail biting action. It has side characters with emotional beats, that despite its extremely fast pace doesn't sacrifice it's heart.The film is a non stop thrill ride, with one of the best finales ever. It was so intense in the final act I felt like I couldn't breathe at times. The writing at the end in particular was great and didn't 'betray' the rules of the universe or the table.Overall, just do yourself a favour and see John Wick 4. You will not regret it."
202,"Loved the movie and most of the people in the theater loved it too. We clapped and cheered! Oh man, it was such an experience!For me, its the best in the franchise and the one of the best action movies out there! Almost 3-hour long stay passed in a blink of an eye. Sadly, I missed the post-credit scene, saw it on the YouTube.This movie has raised the standard of action movies and set itself as a new subgenre.Also, I just found my new hobby: reading 1-star/negative reviews and their reviews of other movies. They give a new perspective and its fun seeing how they have rated other movies, compare it to yours own. Hahah."
203,"Amazing movie overall. Gets too slow in the beginning, but as story proceeds, John Wick gets into the action. Best cinematography and action sequences. Also, locations and ambience in the movie were really good. The tone of the movie was serious business. Unlike other John Wick chapters this one contains some funny parts, which is a plus. Background music is just same as the others, and really suits to the style and action. Best chapter in all JW series and it is a must watch.Also, this JW chapter does travel across multiple nations and involves different characters from different ethinics :)"
204,"I have to start by saying this movie is not that bad movie, had to give only one star because this is really overrated, when i write this, this movie has 8.6 stars, i think 6 is correct for this movie. So we waited many years to see this movie and what disappointment this was compared to prequels. There was zero emotion in this one, really stupid plot because how the movie ends and the outcome would have been same if he hadn't killed the manager at the start, so when the movie ends you are kind a left with the disappointment feeling that this is why i watched almost three hours this endless repeating action movie, but this is not the worst thing about the movie... Donnie Yen charecter Caine is blind and still shoots in a pistol duel and all bullets hit the target, he magically knows playcards what he has in hand when playing poker and the church staircase scene was laughable, it's like 5 year old boy would have written this movie...fighting scenes are silly, there are many enemies coming everywhere, but still john fight mostly one on one and the others are just goofing around in the background waiting their asses to get kicked. John survives huge drops, hitting by a car and immediatly continue fighting again... prequels had way better action scenes and way better emotional John Wick, this wick seemed like he was lost..."
205,"But still a good film. The originality of the John Wick movies was the realism ( or as close as possible ) of the action scenes. In this 4th movie the images and the sets are better but for a grown up, the fight scenes are sometimes hilarious in every way possible. Also, the fact that Caine is blind erases by half his credibility ... a must not have done in my opinion. Thumbs way up for Bill Skarsgard and Shamier Anderson. I don't know if they should have stopped at the third, it is still entertaining but it takes a down slide road of the saga. Not even close to the second, which I think it still is the best of all 4."
206,"Perfect action movie ever created, This is perfect scenes shot with ever nerve wrecking killing scenes and background music hit it to different level.Blind man has to gain where john has left with nothing to loose, what if john dies you can feel what if he fails and dead, Active action movie for watch.Perfect action movie ever created, This is perfect scenes shot with ever nerve wrecking killing scenes and background music hit it to different level.Blind man has to gain where john has left with nothing to loose, what if john dies you can feel what if he fails and dead, Active action movie for watch."
207,"A true John Wick fan here. Unfortunately, this is the least of the 4. What I liked about the other 3 was the close combat and the sheer bruteness of how kills where portrayed. 1 is a 9, 2 is a 10, and I give 3 an 8. S if I give 4 a 6, it says it all. In John Wick 4 it is more in the open and it just doesn't feel the same. The fight scenes are just not as good as in the other movies. It's a decent film, especially the scene with Scott Adkins is good (he steels the show, give this man a spinoff or his own movie), and the scene with the shot from above is awesome. The cinematography is great, but I go to John Wick for the kills (who doesn't) and it just doesn't give me the vibe that the other movies had.However, a must see if you want to get closure for the franchise."
208,"Saw it yesterday at the cinema. Well, I can't quite agree with the praise.The film is clearly too long, the action scenes all get out of hand and you only see more of the same killing scenes, which are boring and tough in the long run. Less would have been more here.Attention, there are a few spoilers to a few fight scenes.Chapter 4 takes the ""nonsense"" to the extreme again. I'm a fan of well choreographed fights, but not when it's just overplayed to the max. John Wick once again fights HORDES of assassins and walking fortresses, but they are all too stupid to hit John and always miss. It's also interesting that John Wick must think he's Neo, since he's constantly ""dodging"" bullets by ducking and taking slight sideways steps. By John being invincible, it's just not fun to watch him kill, because it's unsatisfying victory, kind of like a cheat in a game or some kind of god mode. It would have been much more intense and emotional for me as a viewer if John was significantly more vulnerable and if there had been more noticeable character development and motivation. It would have been enough to reduce the kill count from over 200 to under 20, but to stage the individual fights more brutally, more intensively and, above all, more realistically and credibly (e.g. As in Atomic Blonde or Mission: Impossible).I also find these ""armored"" suit guys stupid. John often shoots whole magazines at these guys, and the bullets bounce off the suit as if the outer fabric was already made of 1 cm steel. But the fact that the suit guys are still very agile is even more laughable. And the suits are still as clean and intact as if they had just been bought and ironed. These suit guys don't have head protection, though, which is why I find it ridiculous that John imemr shoots at their bodies and not directly at their heads. He seems to be shortsighted, because he only ever shoots at the head when he's extremely close to the enemy. However, when enemies wear complete body armor including ballistic helmets, John strangely always shoots at their heads even from a distance, until after ten or fifteen shots he finally shoots into the helmet/head from below. If you multiply these kind of kills by 100, you have an idea of how often John kills hundreds of killers in the same way.Furthermore, I find it very nonsensical that there are no police in the world who intervene at times.The scene in Paris at this big traffic circle with several lanes is also totally crazy. John and the killers shoot at each other on the traffic circle for over ten minutes, and the ""civilians"" just drive on like robots at 50 km/h and just keep running over some killers and John, though John never takes any damage from it. But no one stops, gets out and runs away in fear. The traffic keeps flowing, despite wild killing by shooting and wild running over.As for the staging of the action scenes: For every well-staged action scene, there are unfortunately three mediocre and boring action scenes that always follow the same pattern, see my comments above. And even the best action scenes are not necessarily as ""groundbreaking"" or ""novel"" and ""groundbreaking"" as some critics claim. I found a whole two action scenes very successful, once the much too short! (where all the others are way too long) chase scene in the Mustang and once the top-down fight scene. The highly praised staircase fight scene I found again much too long and also very 08/15, because John again makes his always same kills, while all the others always hit only the staircase railings or lanterns, but not John.The story isn't worth mentioning and doesn't make much sense in terms of content. Interestingly enough, the nice dialogues and dialogue scenes are still one of the best things about the movie.The sound is well mixed though, the camerawork is well done and the visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and there are a few nice references to Matrix (rain fight scene and the train station).Now all of this sounds rather like a poor or mediocre rating, but that wouldn't do the film justice. It offers good entertainment on a technical level above mediocrity and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch. Therefore I still give it a solid rating, despite all my reservations.Rating: 7/10 pointsRewatch Value: LowEmotional depth: LowLasting impression: None."
209,"Not only was this easily the best John Wick Movie... but this is 100% got to be the top action movie created. May seem far fetched, until you sit in the theater and watch this unbelievable movie. There is simply not a movie that can compare to the action displayed in this film. Unbelievable choreography and stunts, plus an amazing hit man storyline.This movie shows the true capabilities that John Wick has... and also introduces some awesome new characters, and every character is perfect fitted for this movie. I don't see one thing in this movie that was bad and I highly recommend it to any viewer that has the chance to watch!!"
210,"Honestly , there's to much action , not enough sex on screen and Keanu is not a good actor . The set pieces of this movie was beautiful and again , the fights are well done but this movie just felt long and pointless . At times I seen about 4 people asleep in the theaters , then seen half of them pretty
Much sleeping . One person puked from the constant action this movie kept throwing at your face . If you like pointless fights with a lot of violence , bad acting and terrible written characters , this movie fits right up your alley! Just bring a blanket , a pillow and get ready for the greatest action nap of your life ."
211,"Remembering John Wick the first movie I was enthralled by the mysterious, feared and shadowy Mr Wick who offered up intrigue and overwhelming focus for revenge. The skills and fortitude presented by the character added the action to an action movie.The following movies John wick -4 SERIOUSLY lack in any sort of storyline except guns, killing and an unrealistic ability to not get shot dead in a hail of a million bullets fired by 'professional' Sicarios.The latest instalment was absolutely no different, the storyline is weak and boring, the main character must be a god to not die in the usual hail of bullets AND being run over more than 3 times.TBH I towards the end in the stairwell scene I was WISHING someone would just kill the John there and then, after all he's just fallen hundreds of stone steps, gets up and starts again... Total Bull.The usual bull of the good guy being able to kill a hundred hardened criminal well armed fighters just to be thwarted by a single unimpressive and willowy man is rife within the movie industry, Its a shame they also applied such a ridiculous storyline in this movie.Thankfully then end scene was a total surprise, that part alone was worth the price of the popcorn, but not the hotdog!THANKFULLY his character is dead.. Or is he?"
212,"The best fking movie in all of the John wick franchise .Action sequences top notch , got a 15 minute continuous one take action sequences. This film got guns, cars , dogs , class , suit and motherfking iconic characters .The action done by Keanu Reeves was the best . The director's love for neon colours is clearly seen in the movie and the all the mythology about the high table, continentals about different hotels throughout the world the leaders who control it the rules on which this big assassin world works which the high table even cannot defy. The tone of the story is set from the start by the death of two important characters we know this time that the stakes are real and it is the best one till now .Those who cling to death live. -John."
213,"John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story."
214,"Everyone in the movie gets killed, but they return quickly and continue fighting. All of them are superheroes with build-proof bodies or dresses, which is dame comedy.Three long hours of killing without any acting, and the only purpose is it kills, but everyone will keep him until the end, oh God. John wick started with the killing of his beloved wife's gift ""The dog"" which is a great comedy but good to watch the action. This movie's action is directly taken from the video game is too much. They target the gaming group and not the other action movie lovers but why do the reviews and rating groups consider this movie as the best is rising big question."
215,I was really excited about this movie since it had such good reviews in here. Now I know that I won't be trusting any IMDB reviews ever again - So far the worst movie I've ever seen.I can't believe they managed to stretch 20 minutes script into 3 hours. Plot didn't move forward at all. Fighting scenes were EXTREMELY long and unrealistic. Acting was poor and hard to watch. Dialogues that were apparently meant to be « funny » were the corniest I've ever heard.To be honest I would watch Shark Tornado or Twilight rather that this.Do yourself a favor and use your spear 3 hours to something else. This wasn't worth of the money or the time.
216,"After watching this masterpiece the thing I realised is it's not only Keanu Reeves it's all about stunts cinematography technical department at everything level beast. The whole franchise was never before ever after series.Well they saying it's lengthy is it I don't think so. A well written directed masterpiece. Movie of the year. If you don't watch this in theatre later u realise how can I miss this so do yourself a favour watch this."" They call him BABA YAGA "" for a reason you truly deserve this man Keanu Reeves at his age doing like this stunts is insane. The stunts action sequences are very real."
217,"If you're a fan of the JW franchise than you're fan of the entire franchise and this movie will not disappoint. It does start off a little slower than the last movie as far as the insane action but It's one of the best written JWs yet(at least in my opinion) and the story is partially why the action takes just a hair longer to get to. But not to worry cause the action comes and it comes strong! By now we all know what to expect from the JW movies and if we are watching them, it's because we enjoy what they offer. For me this movie is one of the best written as far as the story goes. I truly enjoyed learn about the parts of the table previously unknown. I'm not sure how I would feel it they ever did these movies without Keanu (as a spin off or something, not even sure I'd give them a chance.) I think when Keanu is done, they should do what a lot of studios don't do and Call It a Success and Say Goodnight! Leave this one be to remain one of the greatest action Series in cinema... Go see it and enjoy."
218,"The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?"
219,"John Wick 4 is an exceptional addition to the already gripping John Wick series. This movie is undoubtedly the best modern thriller that you can watch and and the best one of the series. Without revealing any spoilers, I can confidently say that the action sequences in this movie are some of the best that you will ever see. The top-down action sequence was particularly awe-inspiring, and it made me feel like I was playing AAA title like Max Payne 3. The way the action scenes are choreographed is simply outstanding, and it is something that has become synonymous with the John Wick series.Overall, I would highly recommend John Wick 4 to anyone who is a fan of action movies. The level of excitement and intensity that this movie delivers is unmatched."
220,"This Film is packed with great amount of action with a tiny punch of humor and remarkable storyline. There are lots of moments when the audience would spontaneously cheer up between the scenes. John Wick films have a great thing as it progresses with every sequel and Chapter 4 doesn't fail to do so, instead it's the summit of all 4 movies. The end of the film synchronize with perfect ending for great story. The screenplay, direction and scenes keep getting better and better throughout. As they say what makes action scene perfect is background music and the team has gone limitless to provide so with intense action music that won't let you blink your eyes. Overall it's a must watch movie for every fan as well as those who seek to enjoy action films."
221,"It would be understandable if JW was a terminator(not a human assasain), but as that it is not understandable how can he fall from 4th floor of a building, bend a car and be left without a scratch and perfectly able to walk(and many other simillar situations). Blindman appears to feel where are distant people to shoot but he can not feel where is JW even when he is breathing heavily next to him. 20 people shooting at him (some even wait for their turn) and none of them can hit. In conclusion all the shooters were blind, drunk and drugged or wind have blown the bullets away. Sadly, at the end a man who survived all the impossible things even for a movie dies from superficial wound."
222,"No spoilers here but wow! Amazing! I was very disappointed with John Wick 3 and felt the series declining, this is a complete step up from that film.I love my action films, especially martial arts and this has things I've never even seen in Hong Kong action cinema before. So glad Donnie Yen also was able to shine, I expected him to have a few scenes then be out but he's along for a large chunk of the film without giving anything away. The choreography is on another level and blows everything else out of water. The story is also well written and there isn't just action for no reason. I recommend watching in IMAX if you can."
223,"Amazing movie in every sense of the work. More action than any of the other Wick flicks let alone any movie of all time. Great mix of storytelling drama, action, big name actors, soundtrack (omg), cinematic landscapes, combat, weaponry, blood, guts and more. Spectacular performances from all stakeholders including Ian McShane (Winston) who seemed to steal the show in every scene he was in. Donnie Yen was also incredible. I deducted 0.5 stars simply because the limited involvement of Lawrence Fishburne. He was missed. Other than this there are disappointments here. They went all in to produce this one and it is a masterpiece!"
224,"Anything that you do is everything
Consequences
Without rules we're animals
All distilled downWow, wow, wow! What a movie. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made .Afraid to say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is perfect and a masterpiece in every aspect. This movie proves everyone wrong. I can proudly say that this is the best action movie i have ever seen on the big screen. Nothing can be compared to it.. must watch movie..Keanu Reeves' exceptional performance takes the action sequences to an entirely new level, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made ."
225,"It had a decent story for john wick with lots of action. It seemed like it tried to combine all the action of the first 3 into this movie. Some interesting characters- the blind ninja fighter and the wannabe bad guy, it was good to see Clancy Brown in this movie. Some fight scenes were really good. Some may have went too long yet Decent overall. The music and background music wasnt as good as the first 3- some of the fight music sounded like it was taken right from The other john wicks. They Definitely gave it a more of a New York feel with the classic new york movie they paid homage to in this movie."
226,"After the semi letdown of JW3 I was so happy that 4 made up and more. This was my favorite of the franchise. It had everything that you would expect from this movie. The fight scenes, gun scenes, choreography, music.... great soundtrack!! All were perfectly chosen. There were a few scenes where I felt the music could have been much louder. It was an odd choice and I'll crank it way up at home. They brought in some new characters ... likeable characters. I could see a spin-off with nobody. Something else with a couple others that had some loose ends that were not neatly completed.John wick 4 really tied things together well and had a great moral to the story. It showed that our actions have consequences. Watch it on the big screen and enjoy some time with sn old friend."
227,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best movie in the franchise and one of greatest action movies ever made period!!!!! Characters are great especially Donnie Yen's Caine, he stole the whole fu$$ing movie - his acting and fight scenes are just masterpiece, this is Donnie's best Hollywood movie yet. Scott Adkins' Killa was also amazing, even in fatsuit he was fighting like a with out it and his fighting style reminded me of the legendary Sammo Hung in SPL: Killzone (2005), Bill Skarsgard played propably the best villian of all JW films. Action Sequences were insane, amazing, epic, incredible, jaw-dropping."
228,"I expected a better film. First of all, I think the fighting scenes and the handling of weapons are very good, as I was used to from the other parts. Also, the scenery is very good and vivid. I also find it good that many of the characters appear again. However, I also have some criticism, so most of the fight scenes are too exaggerated and one-sided. Without exception, all shots at john wick go nowhere and thus the scenes were always very boring. But I also have to complain about the story, because some things do not really make sense and some actions do not sign the actual intentions of the characters. It's a shame that this film series finds such an end."
229,John wick chapter 4 was probably the best John wick yet it was alot better than chapter 3 for sure. Adding Donnie yen to the cast was a nice touch and him playing a blind man was incredible now that is something different his martial arts skills was incredible. The actor bill don't ask me to spell his second name because that is a mouthful lol but he did do an incredible job for the action probably the best action you will likely see in an action movie again incredible keanu reeves did an amazing job that's what got me liking keanu reeves after seeing the first chapter the scene at the end was different and in my opinion spoiled it a little bit.
230,"John wick chapter 4 is definitely the best action movie in John wick series. It is not only the best movie in the series but also the best Action movie ever made.Overall John wick series has been the most beautiful master piece of Action movies.John wick chapter 4, is a masterpiece from beginning of the film to end and to post credit scene.On a personal level i may not be a fan of the ending of the film, but i was prepared for that kind of ending of this movie.I Would like to see Mr. Wick alive in the next part.Wil wait for bellerina and the continental to see what comes next in this movie series. I am hoping to see John wick in action. If this is the end, then Miss you BABA YAGA."
231,"John Wick is not my cup of tea. I never saw the first 2 of the series, but I did see the 3rd one when it came out few years ago. Still, I'm not too familiar with the story nor do I have an emotional investment in what this is. Seeing John Wick 4, I want to see it again. It's a bit long, which is my only complaint. 30 minutes shorter and I would've given this a 9 out of 10. I also don't connect as much with John as well as I did with every other character. I was rooting for Donnie Yen more than John. Even with heavy plot armour and dodging more bullets than any action star in history, Reaves gives Wick a strong action presence. It's comedic how unrealistic he surmounts so much and yet it's kick ass.The main thing is how well shot this movie is. The cinematography is top notch. Some of the imagery is beautiful. Most importantly, the action is filmed without shaky cam or too many close-ups. You can see everything without getting disoriented. It's terrific. My favourite part of the movie was the first act at Asoka's hotel. The build-up and fight sequence there is one of the most memorable set pieces I've ever witnessed in an action movie. What I liked is how most of the action is physical combat, which I think was the same in the previous instalments. However, the entire fight at the hotel was so good. The emotion between the father and daughter really stood out to me. There could be a whole other movie about the daughter. The kung fu sword fighting is something I want to see more of.Finally, we have the the standoff at the end. It is beautiful and surprisingly unpredictable how it plays out. John Wick 4 is my favourite action movie in years and will be remembered as one of the best closing movies in a franchise ever, if it is the final one."
232,"There is such a thing as too much of a good thing. I'll keep this spoiler free but in closing the movie was nearly 3 hours and it could have been 105 minutes. To sum up where this movie went wrong, just watch the episode of the office where Micheal explains the downfall of the Diehard series. Also the plot and character motivations make absolutely no sense. It's only 5/10 because choreography was really well done. You believe he knows how to actually shoot but at the end of the day John Wick is supposed to be human, not a mix of wolverine, Hawkeye, and have a suit that doubles as captain America's shield. This movie is ruined like a video game can be ruined by god mode."
233,"The movie is worth the wait. This movie franchise has set the bar really high for action movies and it is going to be a benchmark of sorts for the action movies of future. Keanu Reeves is amazing, as he has been in the first 3 installments. Donnie Yen is treat to watch and his action sequences are just mind blowing. The run time is a bit on the higher side but you will not feel that. The action seems a bit over the top at certain times but it does not last long. This movie franchise is making audience fall in love with close combat action and its good. Watch it in a good theater with proper sound and screen. The experience will be enhanced."
234,"I dunno why but that just bothered me, as someone who's spent time in Japan, and has many relatives there.Anyway, that's all I had to say. I will now leave the lobby and go back to the theatre, since I stepped out to answer a phone call, and wound up writing a terrible movie review as well.Im guessing this will be a 7.5-8, but I'm only like half an hour into this. Hope I'm right.Ok I need more characters, so I'm back in the theater. This half Japanese looking girl is talking to Hiroyuki Sanada, who looks good as always. Dang he's handsome.Alright no spoilers so far, but this is getting boring. I hope this picks ups soon, I'll change my review if it doesn't."
235,Said only in death he would have peace and to be free again. No ties to the table at all anymore. So is he really dead or retired again. Baja yaga sent chills doen their backs and he taking out more then the table probably could imagine. What will make Mr. Wick return from the shadows and will he have his car? Winston knew what Johnathon had planned which is to be free once more to never be bothered again. To morn his wife which he really never had a chance to at all. Hopefully there's another twist which only two different reasons can make him come out the shadows and that's the daughters of his friends.
236,"Look, let's just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain't a ""chapter."" It's a whole damn book - a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium of all manners of asskickery.Full review at ScreenCrush. (And after you see the movie, here's my interview with Chad Stahelski that's JUST about the stairwell scene that I am sure will go down in history as one of the all-time great moments in action cinema.) Everyone is trying to rip off the way John Wick movies do action but I wish they would also try to rip off the way John Wick movies are really pretty and lit extremely well."
237,"This is the worst John Wick movie out of the 4. This movie is basically just the Long chicken fight scenes from Family Guy. He gets hit by 4 cars full speed, all 1000 enemies have worse aim than stormtroopers they are basically in a single file line waiting their turn to attack him instead of all at once
he never reloads his guns when he should clearly be out of ammo several times. I leaned over to my dad in one scene and said let me guess when him and that guy with the dog meet to where they can both shoot each other both of their guns are going to click and not shoot and then they are going to get into a fist fight 30 seconds later exactly what I said happened the whole movie is the most generic thing I've ever seen. The only good things I can say about this movie are the set designs and scenery all of it's beautifully filmed. Oh ""YEAH"" and he also falls from tall buildings several times and doesn't seem phased at all after hitting poles on the way down."
238,"Yes, it's John Wick. Fans here from the beginning. With that said, I believe the movie run time was just too long. I went with a group of 5 of all ages - 16 to 53. Everyone admitted they dozed off a few times - granted it was a 7:30 show and we got out at 10:30pm. Great actors, and a few new ones that added to the story. I won't spoil it, the one has a major disability that would make it impossible to pull off what he does in the movie. But... this is John Wick, Hollywood, special effects, and we all know John Wick, his Kevlar suit, unlimited ammo and moves... well, who can stop him? 😃 if your a fan, go! If you have not watched the others, watch them first."
239,"This is simply not just the best John Wick movie but one of the best action movies I have ever seen without exagerating, brutal, unique fighting scenes and epic cinematography overall. The movie had a runtime of 169 minutes and I just did not want it to end at all, although you think that you know what might happen next but it always kind of surprises you.The fighting scenes and the coreography is just a pure joy to watch, such a talented cast, even the guys who were 'taking a beating' .It nicely continues the story from where chapter 3 left off and ends with somewhat of an open ending in my opinion, adding new interesting characters, each unique to their own. Just marvelous!"
240,"The ending left me feeling frustrated, empty and just unfulfilled. I feel like I sat through a 3 hour movie... and now 3 previous movies... for nothing. We demand a rewrite. The ending was almost as bad as the last matrix movie. Everything else was fine as far as the storyline goes. How did you think people were going to feel about this/ or react. Like oh my gosh what a wonderful ending.... Now when everyone asks me how the movie was, all I can say is eh, it made me feel worthless at the end. Don't go see it in theater is what I'll say lol Hope it does well after all the bad reviews come out after opening."
241,"After seeing Chapter 4 for the fist time while just vaguely remembering plot of each previous movie I watched just once at the time they came out I didn't know what to think about it. Action, cinematography, stunt work and characters were all great, but I just didn't get the movie.So I decided watch every John Wick back to back and see Chapter 4 again. And I must say, those movies really are one story told in four chapters (so far). They continue where previous left and build on each other really nicely.And Chapter 4 is the biggest, boldest and the most beautiful of them all. I get the movie now and I think that it's brilliant, especially the final part. There is one location that feels bit weaker than the others, but I won't be lowering the score for that."
242,"When the first John Wick movie came out, it revitalized the action movie genre. Nearly 10 years later, and two sequels in, we get arguably the best installment of the franchise. John Wick: Chapter 4 ups the ante on absolutely everything. From stunning set pieces, to non-stop high voltage action sequences.Keanu Reeves once again is breathtaking in the role of the legendary hitman. He is a true inspiration, proving that age is just a number. The guy is in his 50's and is pulling off amazing choreographed action sequences. The action sequences are incredible. Utilizing the setting around them, from Morocco to Japan to France and all the way back to New York, which subsequently makes every scene unique and a stand out. Nothing feels out of place or boring, each scene has prominence and substance to them.John Wicks war against The High Table brings him into conflict with some interesting new adversaries. Bill Skarsgards villainous role as one of the heads of The High Table is menacing, cold and calculating. He pulls the strings of the plot all the way to the end. Donnie Yen yet again plays another blind badass character. This time a hitman who has a history Wick, and a motive that forces him into hunting Wick down. A very cool and compelling character that I hope to see more of later on.The two hour and forty minute runtime went by like a breeze, captivating from the very beginning to the somber bittersweet ending. A satisfying conclusion to John Wicks story, as he was finally at peace with everything and returned home to his wife. I hope his story stays concluded, even though nowadays it seems like no one truly stays dead.In light of the conclusion I can honestly conclude that John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the greatest action movies of all time. Subsequently, the franchise will go down in history as one of the greats, as the bar for action movies reaches a new standard."
243,"Just back from an imax viewing. Admittedly not the biggest action fan but this is undoubtedly has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, the part around the Arc de triomphe especially had me smiling and gasping.Obviously the whole thing is over the top and far fetched and it's a tough knowing how far to push it with giving the viewers what they want but not be such BS that it's off putting. Well unfortunately with this Caine character I just couldn't get into it, for a blind guy to be doing what he was doing throughout the movie in what was very much a main role was just too ridiculous and ruined the whole movie for me. I can see why it's getting the plaudits it is from fans, but reminded me of that one episode of that 'See' that I watched before I shouted BS and switched it off."
244,"A blind man, a homeless guy, and John Wick enter a German club and... No, it's not a joke, it is the wildest action movie of this century.Of course, one can not ignore its thoughtful take on the nature of power, order, and the power of will, but... We would not be honest if we denied the fact that, over all things, this saga is sheer entertainment, powerful visuals of martial arts and gun fu, bigger than life destruction, a non stop pace, and a really thrilling concept of spectacle based on the point of ""more is more"". For if this alone wouldn't be enough, we have stunning suspense and the feel of enormous authority and strength of the French Marquis, and also the deeply emotional and satisfactory dramatic work of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen.What else can I say? Simply WOW, since I have felt definitely blown away by the bird-eye shot in the building with infinite grenade shooting. But... what is infinite? If you are wondering about it, I only have to say: stairs, lots of stairs.The final duel at the sunrise is just deeply satisfying and leaves me thinking we need another fight with Keanu. Let's hope for this to be only a temporal game over, and maybe we can see Mr. Wick down those stairs triumphant.I won't stop him until I see him in Turkey fighting Kenan Imirzalioglu."
245,"Keanu hit gold with this movie series! Lots of the stuff we seen but different in a good way. Amazing ending! You officially topped all my action star list and some more. The easter eggs and The Warriors flashback was genius. I do hope you get the recognition that is well deserved with all the hard work you put into these movies! You will always be praised for your talents and your humility Keanu. We need more of you in the world. Regardless I don't think we have seen the end of the talent and dedication this man has. The top view scene was off the hook!! Amazing! Skip the Matrix stuff, the writers don't know what they are doing anymore. Much love my man! RIP Lance you will be missed!"
246,"If you love a non stop violent action movie with perfectly choreographed fight scenes then this is the movie for you. If you like a crazy story, which is emotional and pulls you in, then this is the movie for you.If this is the end for John Wick then it was a fitting way to go out. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.Sometimes a movie with non stop action will get old and boring very quick, but the constant scene changing keeps it fresh. I love that Wick takes no prisoners, everyone dies.I just hope there will be a chapter 5, these movies are some of the best action going around."
247,I believe this is tied with John Wick 1 as the best John wick movie. Full of action from start to finish. Awesome kills from John and other characters throughout. Great villains throughout the movie very well written too. The cinematography was great. The pacing was fantastic it managed to keep me engaged throughout the whole film with all of the action in between. The whole movie was very well written and you can tell they really tried to make this the best John wick movie and pulled out all of the stops.I believe this was a great way to end the John Wick Franchise. May you Rest in Peace John Wick and more importantly Lance Reddick who was taken from us too soon.
248,"To start, I feel like I should explain why I rated this movie so highly.It's because I was laughing hysterically through half of the 2.5 hour long movie.At no point in this movie did I feel like I was watching a traditional or even new age action thriller. It felt like a parody of John Wick movies. Granted it would have been a good parody if the movie were limited to a standard 1 hour 20 minute runtime, but it felt artificially prolonged.It's a weak and tragic ending to the John Wick series. It's violence becomes inconsequential after a solid and insufferable 25 minute segment near the beginning. It's quirky avant garde settings are so absurd that it destroys any serious emotional moments that the plot tries to push on the audience."
249,Yes no idea ne Can beat Jhon wick omg when I saw this movie definitely No one can beat this movie is the top level action thriller and awesome fighting movie but I'm so sad john wick is dead in part 4 We need again and again john wick hope Hollywood directors and producers understand this comment also we want to know story of Caine donie yen in part 5 Why did he sacrifice his eyes? We want please again john and Caine friendship and story we again want biggest blast we again and again want next level action we again want a top class story all credit of story goes to the director and producers and story makers.
250,"If you enjoyed any of the other three, this is a non-stop roller coaster, amped up to 11. It features a lot of catchy and signature lines, delivered in a way that is both cool and cheesy.The gun-fu is next level, and the addition of Donnie Yen contrasts Reeves's style so well.It's over-the-top and exhausting, exhilarating and beautifully shot. It showcases the best of Wick's humanity. The cinematography is a cut above the previous entries in the series.This is one of the few movie franchises that continues to defy expectations and delivers an experience well worth the price of admission.Stay for the post-credits scene."
251,"I wanted to love it, but I can't. The action was getting tedious after a while and the last 45 minutes I was getting bored. Nothing was really going on and the plot development wasn't there.Now, it's fun to go escape for nearly 3 hours, but I highly doubt this is going to hold up with repeat viewings. And like I said, the other 3 were far more superior than this, since there seemed to be an actual plot.Now the pros. The cinematography was top notch, and Connie Yen stole the show and this movie will make him into a mega star. His character, (a blind assassin) is so much fun, I can see them doing a spin off on him and it could work if done right.But this movie could have cut about 30 to 45 minutes. And there were some scenes, like John Wick falling off unbelievable heights and getting up unscathed that took me out. There is just no way that is possible and really took me out of suspending my belief. The movie was cartoonish at times and I felt I was watching Loony Toons with some of the stunts.So, basically, the movie is a fun popcorn flick, but because it has no whit, no humor and can get tedious from time to time, I can only give it 6 stars. Next time, put some things in there to stimulate our brains."
252,The soundtrack is avant garde but the choreography is dynamite. If the academy could think originally there is no better candidate for best musical and original numbers. Edge of your seat excitement. Don't make plans for later. All the restaurants will be closed by the time you get out of this movie.The soundtrack is avant garde but the choreography is dynamite.

253,"Sensational.... Brilliant...and one of the best action movie of decade...infact it can stand among one of the best action movies of all time. All character has done brilliant justice to thier roles.If you havnt seen any John wick movies before i would suggest go and watch on Netflix...Chapter 4 is best so far among all.Will there be John Wick 5? ...if no...then it should be...all assumption about prequal or spin off may come...but John Wick will be there forever...Brilliant Direction, Cinema...background feel...sounds...action...choregraphy...everythibg wow....head off to the directors actors and all the Team who made this movie a birrliant piece to watch..."
254,"Best Action Scenes in the past years and one of the most impresive choreography and storyline is predictive but surprises at some point. Franchise have been built bigger and Characters in the movie are very good. A new approach has been done by director by giving this movie a new perspective and Cinematography is better than all the previous movies, VFX work is very good but can be easily noticed in some scenes. Movie does not feel like stretched and Comedy is added in this part which i liked, All Credit goes to stuntman, Director and New Music is very great. Background Score is also very good."
255,"Sometimes when you have high expectations for a movie, probably you could be disappointed. However this new chapter on the John Wick saga takes you into a new dimension of action. Some of these action sequences are very original, you can note a hard work to make a difference respect other action movies. The electronic soundtrack is an excellent complement for the action. I recommend to see the movie in a IMAX cinema, this way you'll experience all the action details and the amazing sound. I usually see movies on IMAX and I call tell you the John Wick sound is absolutely amazing respect others movie in the same format."
256,"Never seen this detailed cinematography in an action movie ever.This is a brand new standard set for any future action movie. It was an ultimate experience, every bit of scenes location, use of camera, cast, characters just perfection.It reminded me, back in 2009 when James Cameron set a standard of film making of Avatar.Well now this John Wick Chapter 4 is definitely going to set a big record.Shooting scenes were so realistic, use of weapons and swords just remarkable.By looking at length of the movie you might think it's going to be a long and boring. But actually it's not, you're going to enjoy every millisecond of this masterpiece."
257,"Some context, of all the John Wick's, I'd seen the 2nd one, and thought it was great. However, after a 20 minute YouTube recap of all 3 I felt I was good to go. Although rather unnecessary as the movie is pretty easy to follow. So don't think it's important to have seen the others.I'll keep this simple:If you want to see 3 hours of well choreographed non-stop violence with some questionable decisions from the surrounding members of the public and some unfathomable bone break escapes from Mr Wick. Then this movie is for you.Went to see it in a packed IMAX and so many people around me were visibly bored and audibly exasperated with the movie.The one saving grace was a hilarious slapstick stairs moment towards the end which had the whole cinema laughing out loud.I did enjoy the warriors homage too.In a nutshell, if you want an excuse to eat a large popcorn then you'll have 3 action packed but long hours to get to the hard kernels at the bottom."
258,"This is a must see movie. JW: Chapter 4 continues to deliver on the outstanding action and fantastic performances. I would also argue that this is the most visually stunning of all the movies. Hardly any single minute is wasted multiple great build ups and payoffs throughout the movie. If you've already been a fan of the first 3 movies, I cannot recommend seeing this one enough. And for any newcomers: I just cannot emphasize how superb the JW franchise is as a whole.The epic fighting sequences are so well done that it felt like watching a well choreographed fighting ballet.It is indeed the best action Movie i have ever seen! Period."
259,"Best Movie ever seen. I thought chapter 4 will disappoint but not and this makes me Jabra Fan of John Wick. Entry of John Wick was awesome. I Love there concept.

260,"Wow!! This was such an awesome time for me and my family. If you've seen any of the the first three John Wick movies, you know they are action filled.....But get ready for a new standard in packing action into a movie. New guns, new twists, so much excitement. It is a long movie, but if you like tons of fighting and action it keeps you wanting more. It's definitely a popcorn flick, but so good and entertaining. Unlike the last three Wick movies, Chapter 4 had the audience laughing out loud at several scenes. Without being a spoiler, I'll just say there are a few really funny things that happen. We absolutely loved it and can't wait for Chapter 5. Keanu is great!!"
261,"Donnie has gone an excellent act of a disabled assassin that battled every fight. He shall be nominated for Oscar Best Supporting Actor! No questions!Why? He proved to be a best assassin in hardships like he can do anything except see. He excelled in the martial art fights. The character of Caine applied to the biblical example of being a sinner so Donnie has done an excellent job of being good guy and bad guy in Marquis's expectations.Donnie also done excellent acting as the disabled assassin in the mob world and challenged John Wick, Caine's friend into the battle. Caine beat everyone include John Wick. Donnie is a winner in Oscar nomination!"
262,"Really a great thriller movie. It has surprised to its viewers with something new. When you go to the cinema hall you will see a new content , scene and will applaud . Don't miss the scene when there will be a first part club music. Really 10 star rating. Joh wick have a great action thriller and the most important is you can see the camera angles the way it's directed the scene were really amazing. You will think what will be next and will be surprised when the people of the high table starts attacking John Wick. Also it has shown in the start about the women empowerment and the message that friendship is everything always maintain. And the women are more stronger than what we think."
263,"There are no words to describe the fourth installment of this epic saga. The cast, the dialogue (or the lack of it!), the action scenes and various backdrops that really set the scene for the conclusion of this blockbuster. I literally reached nirvana when I saw Keanu pull out his gun for the 600th time to shoot the bad guys. I can't recommend it enough! It certainly is the best action film I've ever seen, and I've seen many, as I don't have other hobbies or interests in my life. Don't call me a loser, I rather you refer to me as a fan. It's a no brainer movie guys and you know what ? I like it a lot, thinking about the tattoo now....."
264,"I was really looking forward to this final installment of the the Keanu Reeves titular character as I loved the previous 3 in the series and up until the film went rip-off the rails I was suspending the superhuman resilience of Johnny Wick himself. But when they brought in a dj towards the latter part of the film the film lost my support. The reason for this is that it is a direct rip-off of the Warriors, one of my favorite films. From the dialogue to the use of Nowhere to Run, it was the director's insert that, excuse the expression, proverbially killed the movie for me. I read after seeing the movie that the director wanted to homage the film but this extraneous garbage was so cringe for me. Maybe a lot of people who never saw the Warriors won't care, but for me, it displayed a useless insert. It was almost word for word plagiarism. It took me out of the film until the final scene when I was sort of able to finish the film with some assemblage of enjoyment. Sad how certain things can ruin a good thing. Oh, and the tag after the credits was so predictable, especially since word got out that certain surviving characters were spinning off into their own films, etc. If that dj scene weren't in the film, I'd be giving it a higher rating."
265,Absolutely entertaining and Best of the best action movie ever made. Non-Stop action totally worth money. There is no any minutes that you fell board. If you have high expectations for this movie that you won't be disappointed you gonna love it. I think this is the movie best action movie ever made so till the date. I had little expectations for this movie but it actually surprised me and there is not single minute that I don't feel bored since the beginning of this movie. This movie will surely make $1B box office I absolutely love this movie I don't usually like movie that early but is one is dope.
266,"I love the John Wick series, and this seems a fitting end if indeed it is the end.The fight scenes are some of the best ever on film, and the new characters introduced in chapter 4 were great!If you stuck around for the scene at the end of the credits you saw how they left it open for a possible 5,(not everything is as it seems perhaps?!)Don't really have anything to criticize with this one, it was pretty awesome.Now, I'm assuming this review will actually get posted because I did not say anything negative that'll offend a certain political party, so enjoy everyone, cheers!A+++++++++++"
267,"Ok this movie is exactly what you expect John wick been good at what he does. I don't want to go in detail because of spoilers but I'll try the best I can one of the main characters at the beginning a character that we all love found his fate can't help but making you awwww. The culture of one the friends of wick is pretty cool. Parts of Germany, France, and New York great scenes and the fights. Spoiler alert there a lot of gun shots. Lol the bad guy kinda of annoying and such a cliche. But guess kinda work. My only issue was the annoying black dj girl trying so hard to sound cool. Sorry. But the warriors made it cool this was just a wannabe. And the end it was so cool wait until the end of the credits."
268,"Keanu Reeves is beautiful he is my wife. (love love)and the action scene is cool. Great shot and beautiful scene changes. If we just talk about actors and shots is nearly perfect. BUT!!!!!! The plot is xxxx. I don't know how families is and I don't know how so call table is. And why they fight, fight for what? Power fight between families and table?(like politics fight)? I don't know, that makes no sense at all. Btw, 1,2 and 3 is fresh in action movies and make me feel new, with a almost clear outline of plot. 4 as the end is ok, a end with ""who knows"" but may be happy ending. But if 4 is a single movie, it's failed."
269,"This newest chapter is honestly just as good, if not better, than the first one. I was a little concerned since the two previous ones only got crazier and crazier, trying to one up each other. But this one's story, plot, set pieces, and action is actually the best we've seen from the franchise so far. The casting was perfect, all the actors did a phenomenal job and I can't forget about Lance Reddick. It was a little sad knowing what happened to him in real life but, as always, his actual performance in the movie was amazing. I'd strongly recommend this to any fan of this series. You won't be disappointed."
270,"Before there was a story, and a lot of shooting, now there is just shooting and no story pief, paff poef. Everybody's dead.??? Is this a metaphor for the current society? Did I mention the movie is way too long we watched this in IMAX and my ears were hurting from the gun noise. The fighting scenes are pretty awesome and the scenery is nice, but I think good movie needs more than justice this. I wouldn't recommend to watch this at home and not in the theatre. You can have a break and adjust sound yourself.. I do hope there won't be a sequel for movies of the same character must be enough. Just make a video game of it."
271,"The best action movie I have ever seen in my life I recommend it for all the action scenes, the sound effects and especially the cinematic effects of movement around the shot excellent 👌 with the lighting effects of the locations it was crazy.the best of the franchise, the length is about 3 hours, it doesn't feel heavy, it's the best, the scenes in Tokyo are very enjoyable, the new weapons, WOW very cool, great that they include new martial arts actors, it was super to see them fight, the change of focus that the character suffers is incredible, the action exceeded my expectations, you really have to see it. This movie is a work of art."
272,I would like to say is there any movie which can compact with John wick?? I doubt that well its because of two reasons one the director of this movie Chad .. ufff perhaps the best and second.. well should I give into to this man... naah the one and only Keanu Reeves.. he is the best ever can't imagine John wick doing by other actor... no never only Keanu can he is the best... the way he is doing martial arts.. just mind blowing... he is not a martial arts he learned for this movie.. but the amount of acting he has put is just mind blowing.He is what he is as always... Want to see more of his action film in future.. and about movie I'm not going much into .. just go and watch it in theater only.. cause that I it you will get to know how they made this kind of film.. so don't wait go to theater watch it .
273,"After the first film ended, it was clear to me that the filmmakers had done something special. Upon the ending of the 4th installment, I can say with confidence that this is likely the best action movie ever made. I stray away from action movies due to overused tropes, abundant cgi, and weak characters. This franchise breaks the mold, and gives us well thought out characters that we CARE about. Its ideas are fresh and exciting. The cinematography here may get Oscar- nominated. The fight choreography is simply the best in the business.Aside from Wick taking some unrealistic falls and brushing them off as only a bruise, I was wholly engrossed in # 4 for its almost 3 hour run time. If you're like me and don't bother going to the movies for action pics, do yourself a favor. Find the most extravagant screen you can, and go see this film in theaters. This is what they were made for."
274,"Watched all 3 John Wick and was excited about the 4th installment. My apologies if my slightly low rating offends some people. I'll keep spoilers to a minimum.The movie starts and picks up immediately from where it left off from the previous movie wasting zero time. Fast paced action like the previous installments. The visuals are good with a lot of scenes being very colorful despite most of the fight scenes takes place at night. Fight arenas where huge fights break out are visually stunning just like the previous installment.Sound composer is superb with subtle heart rhythm in certain scenes, although not Christopher Nolan level but certainly very interesting use of sound effects.Vast array of weapons used and some interactions conducted in the local language which is what the real world is like. You don't go to some foreign country expecting their people especially big time crime lords to speak English all the time. I also see someone took inspiration from Jackie Chan stunt technique to make some fight scene looks serious and comical at the same time.At the end of the movie, it's a huge relief seeing the burden being lifted of John Wicks, the man himself Keanu Reeves and the moviegoers whom have been diligently following through a 4 movies.The cons and spoilers
Character development seems to have taken back seat compared to previous movies. The movie also looks rushed as some sharp eye audiences will notice.The plot might be linear and fast paced just like the Fast Furious series but the main difference being, if someone is watching JW4 for the first time with no background knowledge is going to be left with a lot of questions.Wouldn't it be much more engaging if Winston was killed instead of his concierge? Then his concierge being the loyal servant works with other concierge members around the world to help JW avenge Winston's killer. First time watchers would be pleased too.And JW this time seems to have his entire magical 3 piece suit made out of vibranium. Sustaining little injuries despite having platoons of men and women unloading obscene amounts of rounds at one man. Perhaps they all graduated from stormtrooper school.The previous movies sees JW taking hits, seeking medical care and more character development where the audience feels more for him. David vs Goliath moment. His death scene almost looks too good, did they hire a coroner for his make up? The blood patches look too dry like its painted on. Ironman's death looks spot on as completely devastated shock, awe and peace at the same time.Action scene in Japan seems to have the stuntman ninjas frozen in literal fear for his life. They just stood there shaking in fear waiting for JW to mercifully dispatch them. Then seem all fine and dandy taking shots from a machine gun but one throw from JW against the wall, they stand shaking in fear.Waterfall that works in mysterious ways, haven't figured out how the waterfall club works as he fight completely drenched but walks down the stairs little water dripping off him.It's a relief to see the man and the legend can finally closed off the original franchise for good."
275,"10/10 best movie of the year I will definitely rewatch it on the weekend highly recommend
Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series
I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow."
276,"I watched this at Imax and actually considered leaving the theater before the movie was long over. It felt ridiculous, the fighting scenes were so badly done in that Keanu was great in them,as well he was great in the movie, but ALL opponents and people around Keanu were so badly coreographed, not only once but sooo many times the opponents were just ""waiting around"" until Keanu turned around and expedited them. I know this is make-believe but some semblance to reality would have been appreciated. What bad guy in real life does not attack the hero from the back until he turns around, thats when they move. All the other Wick movies surpass this one. The action int eh first and especially the second movie were soo good. These high ratings the movie is getting is unfathomable to me."
277,"From horse race to traffic fight to stair brawl, John Wick deliver what you'd expect from John Wick! The nods for movies like The Warriors and the John Wu movies were just perfect.John Wick : Chapter 4 is a brilliant action movies with creativity, nice camera angle, a blood-soak adventure and so much more. This is possibly the best action movie since a long time. I can't recall the last time I went to the theater to see an action movie and oh boy was it worth my time!My only negative point is that there's not enough action scene with Chidi (Marko Zaror who stared in Undisputed 3) and Killa (Scott Adkins from the same movie) who ate both talented in Martial Art. And for my personal, I would have take more of Hiroyuki Sanada!All in all, John Wick : Chapter 4 is a must see movie!"
278,"Well... how to begin?While the movie is super well made with plenty of fights and special effects... what I'm looking for in a movie (generally) is the suspension of disbelief, but you can forget about that for this movie... some scenes are so ludicrous and ridiculous they made me chuckle and I lost focus more than once.I'm not sure if it was intended... but it felt more like a comedic action movie than an action movie like the 3 previous movies were. Some scene were cut and pieces of previous scene with a different angle or something... the movie felt like a parody of itself half way through... maybe it was intented that way? I was confused to say the least.That being said I was greatly entertained, thus the 8 stars."
279,"JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world."
280,"Loved the movie. Was dying to see this and movie didn't dissapoint. Post-credit scene could lead into a spin-off, but I think that issue will be resolved in ""Ballerina"". John Wicks death was unexpected and I don't really think he died. Even though the movie was long, it didn't feel empty. Always something going on. Also loved the characters. Bill Skarsgård portraid his character perfectly. A little dissapointed that concierge didn't get much screen time. ( Rest in peace Lance Reddick ). Overall I say go watch the movie in your free time. 10/10 definetly go see it in ur local cinema. For sure rewatching in a month or two."
